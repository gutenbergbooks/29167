<h3>EDITOR'S CARD</h3>


<p>This is to certify that the Ex-Crown Princess of Saxony,
now called Countess Montiguoso, Madame Toselli
by her married name, is in no way, either directly or indirectly,
interested in this publication.</p>

<p>There has been no communication of whatever nature,
directly or through a third party, between this lady and
the editor or publishers. In fact, the publication will be
as much a surprise to her as to the general public.</p>

<p>The Royal Court of Saxony, therefore, has no right
to claim, on the ground of this publication, that Princess
Louise violated her agreement with that court as set forth
in the chapter on the <i>Kith and Kin of the ex-Crown
Princess of Saxony</i>, under the heads of "<i>Louise's Alimony
and Conditions</i>" and "<i>Allowance Raised and a Further
Threat</i>."</p>

<h3>THIS BOOK AND ITS PURPOSE</h3>

<p class="center">By Henry W. Fischer</p>


<p>Of Memoirs that are truly faithful records of royal
lives, we have a few; the late Queen Victoria led the small
number of crowned autobiographists only to discourage the
reading of self-satisfied royal ego-portrayals forever, but in
the Story of Louise of Saxony we have the main life epoch
of a Cyprian Royal, who had no inducement to say anything
false and is not afraid to say anything true.</p>

<p>For the Saxon Louise wrote not to guide the hand of
future official historiographers, or to make virtue distasteful
to some sixty odd grand-children, bored to death by the
recital of the late "Mrs. John Brown's" sublime goodness:&mdash;Louise
wrote for her own amusement, even as Pepys did
when he diarized the peccadilloes of the Second Charles'
English and French "hures" (which is the estimate these
ladies put upon themselves).<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The ex-Crown Princess of Saxony suffered much in
her youth by a narrow-minded, bigoted mother, a Sadist
like the monstrous Torquemada; marriage, she imagined,
spelled a rich husband, more lover than master; freedom
from tyranny, paltry surroundings, interference. To her
untutored mind, life at the Saxon Court meant right royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
splendor, liberty to do as one pleases, the companionship
of agreeable, amusing and ready-to-serve friends.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Sad Saxon Court</i></p>

<p>Her experience? Instead of the Imperial mother who
took delight in cutting her children's faces with diamonds
and exposing her daughters to the foul machinations of
worthless teachers&mdash;she acquired a father-in-law (Prince,
afterwards King George) whose pretended affection was
but a share of his all-encompassing hatred, whose breath
was a serpent's, whose veins were flowing with gall; the
supposed chevaleresque husband turned out a walking dictionary
of petty indecencies and gross vulgarities when in
a favorable mood, a brawler at other times, a coward
always.</p>

<p>As to money&mdash;Louise wished for nothing better "than
to be an American multi-millionaire's daughter for a week"!
Amusements were few and frowned upon.</p>

<p>Liberty? None outside of a general permit to eat,
drink and couple like animals in pasture, was recognized or
tolerated. Nor could the royal young woman make friends.
Her relatives-by-marriage were mostly freaks, and all were
unbearable; her entourage a collection of spies and flunkeys.</p>

<p>If charity-bazaars, pious palaver, and orphaned babies'
diapers had not been the sole topic of conversation at court;
if there had been intellectual enjoyment of any kind, Louise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
might never have taken up her pen. As it was: "This Diary
is intended to contain my innermost thoughts, my ambitions,
my promises for the future, <i>Myself</i>. * * * These
pages are my Father-Confessor. I confess to myself. * * *
And as I start in writing letters to myself, it occurs to me
that my worse self may be corresponding with my better
self, or vice-versa."</p>

<p>At any rate she thinks "this Diary business will be
quite amusing."</p>


<p class="center"><i>Louise's Amusing Writings</i></p>

<p>It is. The world always laughs at the&mdash;husband of a
woman whose history isn't one long yawn.</p>

<p>Nor is Louise content with a bust picture.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> She gives
full length portraits of herself, family, friends, enemies, and
lovers, which latter she picks hap-hazard among commoners
and the nobility. Only one of them was a prince of the
blood, and he promptly proved the most false and dishonorable
of the lot.</p>

<p>When Louise's pen-pictures do not deal with her
<i>amororos</i>, they focus invariably emperors and princes, kings
and queens,&mdash;contemporary personages whose acquaintance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
by way of the newspapers and magazines, we all enjoy to
the full, as "stern rulers," "sacrificers to the public weal,"
"martyrs of duty," "indefatigable workers," "examples of
abstinence," and "high-mindedness"&mdash;everything calculated
to make life a burden to the ordinary mortal.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Kings in Fiction and in Reality</i></p>

<p>But kings and emperors, we are told by these <i>distant</i>
observers, are built that way; they would not be happy
unless they made themselves unhappy for their people's sake.
And as to queens and empresses,&mdash;they simply couldn't live
if they didn't inspect their linen closets daily, stand over a
broiling cook-stove, or knit socks for the offspring of inebriated
bricklayers "and sich."</p>

<p>Witness Louise, Imperial and Royal Highness, Archduchess
of Austria, Princess of Hungary and Tuscany,
Crown Princess of Saxony, etc., etc., smash these paper
records of infallible royal rectitude, and superhuman, almost
inhuman, royal probity!</p>

<p>Had she castigated her own kind <i>after</i> royalty unkenneled
her, neck and crop, her story might admit of
doubt, but she wrote these things while in the full enjoyment
of her rank and station, before her title as future queen
was ever questioned or menaced.</p>

<p>Her Diary finishes with her last night in the Dresden
palace. We do not hear so much as the clatter of the car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>riage
wheels that carried her and "Richard" to her unfrocking
as princess of the blood,&mdash;in short, our narrator is
not prejudiced, on the defensive, or soured by disfranchisement.
She had no axes to grind while writing; for her all
kings dropped out of the clouds; the lustre that surrounds
a king never dimmed while her Diary was in progress, and
before she ceases talking to us she never "ate of the fish that
hath fed of that worm that hath eat of a king."</p>

<p>Yet this large folio edition of <i>obsc&eacute;nit&eacute;s royale</i>, chock
full, at the same time, of intensely human and interesting
facts, notable and amusing things, as enthralling as a novel
by Balzac,&mdash;Louise's life record in sum and substance, since
her carryings-on <i>after</i> she doffed her royal robes for the
motley of the free woman are of no historical, and but scant
human interest.</p>

<p>The prodigality of the mass of indictments Louise
launches against royalty as every-day occurrences, reminds
one of the great Catharine Sforza, Duchess of Milan's clever
<i>mot</i>. When the enemy captured her children she merely
said, "I retain the oven for more."</p>


<p class="center"><i>Royal Scandals</i></p>

<p>Such scandalmongering! Only Her Imperial Highness
doesn't see the obloquy,&mdash;sarcasm, cynicism and disparagement
being royalty's every-day diet.</p>

<p>Such gossiping! But what else was there to do at a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
court whose literature is tracts and whose theatre of action
the drill grounds.</p>

<p>But for all that, Louise's Diary is history, because its
minute things loom big in connection with social and political
results, even as its horrors and abnormalities help
paint court life and the lives of kings and princes as they
<i>are</i>, not as royalties' sycophants and apologizers would have
us view them.</p>

<p>There is a perfect downpour of books eulogizing monarchs
and monarchy; royal governments spend millions of
the people's money to uphold and aggrandize exalted kingship
and seedy princeship alike; three-fourths of the press
of Europe is swayed by king-worship, or subsidized to sing
the praises of "God's Anointed," while in our own country
the aping of monarchical institutions, the admiration for
court life, the idealization of kings, their sayings, doings
and pretended superiority, as carried on by the multi-rich,
are undermining love for the Republic and the institutions
our fathers fought and bled for.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Un-American Folly</i></p>

<p>It's the purpose of the present volume to show the
guilty folly of such un-American, un-republican, wholly unjustifiable,
reprehensible and altogether ridiculous King-worship,
not by argument, or a more or less fanciful story,
but by the unbiased testimony of an "insider."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Let it be considered, above all, that a member of the
proudest Imperial family in the wide, wide world demonstrates,
by inference, the absurdity of King-worship!</p>

<p>Of course, whether or not you'll obey the impassioned
appeal of the corner sermonizer, who, espying a number of
very d&eacute;collet&eacute;e ladies passing by in a carriage, cried out:
"<i>Quand vous voyez ces tetons rebondies, qui se montrent
avec tant d'impudence, bandez! bandez! bandez! vous&mdash;les
yeux!</i>" is a matter for you to decide.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Seek not for descriptions of ceremonials and festivities
in these pages; only imbeciles among kings are interested
in such wearying spectacles, intended to dazzle the multitude.
The Czar Paul, who became insane and had his head knocked
off by his own officers, appeared upon the scene vacated by
his brilliant mother, Catharine the Great, with a valise full
of petty regulations, ready drawn up, by which, every day,
every hour, every minute, he announced some foolish change,
punishment or favor, but I often saw Kaiser Wilhelm and
other kings look intensely bored and disgusted when obliged
to attend dull and superfluous court or government functions.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Royalty's Loose Talk</i></p>

<p>But for genuine expressions of the royal self consult
Louise. Those who think that royalty shapes its language<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
in accordance with the plural of the personal pronoun, sometimes
used in state papers, will be shocked at the "n&eacute;glig&eacute;
talk" of one royal highness and the "rag-time" expressions
of others. Louise, herself, assures us over and over again
that she "<i>feels like a dog</i>," a statement no self-respecting
publisher's reader would allow to pass, yet I was told by a
friend of King Frederick of Denmark that he loved to compare
his "all-highest person" to a "<i>mut</i>," and I remember
a letter from Victor Emanuel II to his great Minister, Count
Cavour, solemnly protesting that he (the King) was "<i>no
ass</i>."</p>

<p>When the same Danish ruler, the seventh of his name,
was asked why, in thunder, he married a common street
walker (the Rasmussen, afterwards created Countess Danner),
he cried out with every indication of gusto: "You
don't know how deliciously common that girl is."</p>

<p>Frederick's words explain the hostler marriages of several
royal women mentioned by Louise, as well as her own
and loving family's <i>broulleries</i> of the fish-wife order, repeatedly
described in the Diary.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Royalty Threatens a Royal Woman</i></p>

<p>It is safe to say that few $15 flats in all the United
States witnessed more outrageous family jars than were
fought out in the gilded halls of the Dresden palace between
Louise and father-in-law and Louise and husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
Threats of violence are frequent; Prince George promises
his daughter-in-law a sound beating at the hands of the
Crown Prince and the Crown Princess confesses that she
would rather go to bed with a drunken husband, booted and
spurred, than risk a sword thrust.</p>

<p>At the coronation of the present Czar, at Moscow, I
mistook the Duke of Edinburgh, brother of the late King
Edward, for a policeman attached to the British Ambassador,
so exceedingly commonplace a person in appearance,
speech and manner he seemed; Louise has a telling chapter
on the mean looks of royalty, but fails to see the connection
between that and royalty's coarseness.</p>

<p>Perhaps it wasn't the "commonness" of Lady Emma
Hamilton, child of the slums, impersonator of <i>risqu&eacute;</i> stage
pictures, and mistress of the greatest naval hero of all
times, that appealed primarily to Louise's grand-aunt, Queen
Caroline of Naples, but the abandon of the beautiful Englishwoman,
her reckless exposure of person, her freedom
of speech, certainly sealed the friendship between the adventuress
and the despotic ruler who deserved the epithet
of "bloody" no less than Mary of England.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Covetous Royalty</i></p>

<p>Royal covetousness is another subject dwelt on by
Louise. We learn that in money matters the kings and
princes of her acquaintance&mdash;and her acquaintance em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>braces
all the monarchs of Europe&mdash;are "dirty," that royal
girls are given in marriage to the highest bidder, and that
poor princes have no more chance to marry a rich princess
than a drayman an American multi-millionaire's daughter.</p>

<p>Louise gives us a curious insight into the Pappenheim-Wheeler
marriage embroglio, and refers to some noble
families that made their money in infamous trades;
that the Kaiser adopted the title of one of these unspeakables
("Count of Henneberg") she doesn't seem to
know.</p>

<p>We hear of imperial and royal highnesses, living at
public expense and for whom honors and lucrative employment
are exacted from the people, who at home figure as
poor relations, obliged to submit to treatment that a self-respecting
"boots" or "omnibus" would resent.</p>

<p>Here we have a royal prince of twenty-four or twenty-five
subjected to kicks and cuffs by his uncle, who happens
to be king&mdash;no indignity either to the slugged or the slugger
in that&mdash;but when a pretty princess gets a few "<i>Hochs</i>"
more than an ugly, mouse-colored majesty, she is all but
flayed for "playing to the gallery."</p>

<p>"High-minded" royalty robs widows and despoils
orphans; re-introduces into the family obsolete punishments
forbidden by law; maintains in the household a despicable
spy system! Its respect for womanhood is on a par with
a Bushman's; of authors, "lickspittles" only count; litera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>ture,
unless it kowtows to the "all-highest" person, is the
"trade of Jew scribblers."</p>


<p class="center"><i>Right Royal Manners</i></p>

<p>As to manners, what do you think of kings and princes
and grand-dukes who, at ceremonial dinners, pound the
table to "show that they are boss"?</p>

<p>Louise tells of an emperor at a foreign court ignoring
one of his hostesses absolutely, even refusing to acknowledge
her salute by a nod. We hear of expectant royal heirs
who engage in wild fandangoes of merriment while their
father, brother or cousin lies dying.</p>

<p>"Personal matter," you say? "A typical case," I retort.</p>

<p>"Ask the <i>Duc du</i> Maine to wait till I am dead before
he indulges in the full extent of his joy," said the dying
Louis XIV, when the <i>De Profundis</i> in the death chamber
was suddenly interrupted by the sound of violent laughter
from the adjoining gallery. And the fact that almost every
new king sets aside the testament of his predecessor,&mdash;is this
not evidence of the general callowness of feeling prevailing
in royal circles?</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Irish Famine and Royalty</i></p>

<p>In famine times, the kings and princes of old drove the
starving out of town to die of hunger in the fields, and as
late as 1772 one hundred and fifty thousand Saxons died<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
of hunger under the "glorious reign" of Louise's grandfather-by-marriage,
Frederick Augustus III. And the "Life
of Queen Victoria," approved by the Court of St. James,
unblushingly informs us that in 1847 "Her Most Gracious
Majesty" was chiefly concerned about investing to good
profit the revenues of the Prince of Wales, her infant son
(about four hundred thousand dollars per annum).</p>

<p>Yet, while Victoria pinched the boy's tenants to extort
an extra penny for him, and "succeeded in saving all but
four thousand pounds sterling" of his imperial allowance,
the population of Ireland was reduced two millions by the
most dreadful famine the world remembers!</p>

<p>Before the famine Ireland had a population of 8,196,597,
against a population of 15,914,148 in England and Wales,
while Scotland's population was 2,620,184.</p>

<p>Six years after the famine Ireland's population was
6,574,278, Scotland's 2,888,742, England and Wales' 17,927,609.
Today Ireland's population is less than Scotland's,
the exact figures being: Scotland 4,759,445, Ireland 4,381,951,
England and Wales 36,075,269.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Royalty Utterly Heartless</i></p>

<p>However, as the waste of two million human lives, the
loss of four millions in population, subsequently enabled the
Prince of Wales to tie the price of a dukedom<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in diamonds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
around a French dancer's neck and to support a hundred
silly harlots in all parts of Europe, who cares?</p>

<p>According to Louise and&mdash;others, royalty is the meanest,
the most heartless, the most faithless and the most
unjust of the species&mdash;that in addition she herself disgraced
its womanhood, after the famous Louise of Prussia rehabilitated
queenship, is regrettable, but to call it altogether unexpected
would be rank euphemism.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Louise's Character</i></p>

<p>If Louise had lived at the time of Phryne, the philosophers
would have characterized her as "an animal with
long hair"; if he had known her, the great Mirabeau might
have coined his pet phrase, "a human that dresses, undresses
and&mdash;talks" (or writes) for Louise; as a matter
of fact, she is one of those "<i>Jansenists</i>" of love who believe
in the utter helplessness of natural woman to turn
down a good looking man.</p>

<p>Her great grand-uncle, Emperor Francis, recorded
on a pane of glass overlooking the courtyard of the
Vienna <i>Hofburg</i> his opinion of women in the brief
observation: "<i>Chaque femme varie</i>" (Women always
change).</p>

<p>This is true of Louise and also untrue of her. While
occupying her high position at the Saxon court she was
fixed in the determination to make a cuckold of her hus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>band,
though Frederick Augustus, while a pumpkin, wasn't
fricasseed in snow by any means.</p>

<p>The process gave her palpitations, but, like Ninon, she
was "<i>so</i> happy when she had palpitations."</p>


<p class="center"><i>Changed Lovers Frequently</i></p>

<p>As to lovers, she changed them as often as she had
to, never hesitating to pepper her <i>steady</i> romances by
playing "everybody's wife," chance permitting, as she intimates
na&iuml;vely towards the close of the Diary.</p>

<p>Qualms of conscience she knows not, but of pride of
ancestry, of insistence on royal prerogatives, she has plenty
and to spare.</p>

<p>"My great grand-aunt, Marie Antoinette, did this";
"my good cousins d'Orleans" (three of them) "allowed
themselves to be seduced"; "<i>ma cousine de</i> Saxe-Coburg
laughs at conventionalities,"&mdash;there you have the foundation
of the iniquitous philosophy of the royal Lais. And for
the rest&mdash;when she is queen, all will be well.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Her Court&mdash;A Seraglio</i></p>

<p>Louise's fixed idea was that, as Queen of Saxony, she
had but to say the word to establish a court <i>&agrave; la</i> Catharine
II; time and again she refers to the great Empress's male
seraglio, and to the enormous sums she squandered on her

Russia, when in the flesh, never suffered to be longer than
twenty-four hours without a lover, Louise, no doubt, would
have made the most elaborate plans to prevent, in her own
case, a possible <i>interregnum</i> of five minutes even.</p>

<p>She thought she held the whip hand because a king
cannot produce princes without his wife, while the wife can
produce princes without the king; besides Frederick Augustus
was no paragon, and he who plants horns, must not
grudge to wear them.</p>

<p>A wanton's calculations, it will be argued,&mdash;but Louise's
records show that her husband, the king-to-be, fell in with
her main idea,&mdash;that he forgave the unfaithful wife, the disgraced
princess, because, as Queen, her popularity would be
"a great asset."</p>

<p>And Americans, our women of whom we are so proud,
are asked to bow down to such sorry majesties!</p>


<p class="center"><i>Sired and "Cousined" by Lunatics</i></p>

<p>And is there no excuse for so much baseness in high
places? Our royal Diarist offers none, but her family history
is a telling apology.</p>

<p>Be it remembered that Louise is not so much an Austrian
as a Wittelsbacher of the royal house of Bavaria that
gave to the world two mad kings, Louis II and Otho, the
present incumbent of the throne, besides a number of eccentrics,
among others Louise's aunts, the Empress Elizabeth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
and the Duchess d'Alencon, both dead; Crown Prince Rudolph
of Austria, her cousin, was also undoubtedly insane,
the result of breeding in and in, Austrian, Bourbon and
Wittelsbach stock, all practically of the same parentage, in
a mad mix-up, the insane Wittelsbachers predominating.</p>

<p>To cap the climax, Louise has eighteen or nineteen
insane cousins on her mother's side!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Once upon a time Louise's prosaic and stupid great-uncle,
as a young husband, felt dreadfully scandalized when
his Queen, Marie Antoinette, bombarded him with spit-balls.</p>

<p>"What can I do with her?" he asked "Minister Sans-culotte"
Dumouriez.</p>

<p>"I would spike the cannon, Sire," replied the courtier.</p>

<p>"<i>Enclouer le canon</i>," if performed in time, might have
saved Louise, but I doubt it.</p>

<h3>KITH AND KIN OF THE EX-CROWN PRINCESS OF
SAXONY</h3>


<p class="center"><i>Louise's Own Family</i></p>

<p>The royal woman whose life's history is recorded in
this volume was born Louise Antoinette, Daughter of the
late Grand Duke Ferdinand IV of Tuscany (died January
17, 1908) and the Dowager Grand Duchess Alice, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Princess
Bourbon of Parma.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Louise has four brothers, among them the present head
of the Tuscany family, Joseph Ferdinand, who dropped the
obsolete title of Grand Duke and is officially known as
Archduke of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>He is a brigadier general, commanding the Fifth Austrian
Infantry, and unmarried.</p>

<p>Better known is Louise's older brother, the former
Archduke Leopold, who dropped his title and dignities, and,
as a Swiss citizen, adopted the name of Leopold Wulfling.
This Leopold is generally regarded as a black sheep.</p>

<p>Louise more often refers to him in the present volume
than to any other member of her family.</p>

<p>He is now a commoner by his own, more or less en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>forced,
abdication, as Louise is a commoner by decree of
her chief-of-family, the Austrian Emperor, Francis Joseph,
dated Vienna, January 27, 1903.</p>

<p>A month before above date the Saxon court had conferred
on Louise the title of Countess Montiguoso, while,
on her own part, she adopted the fanciful cognomen of
Louise of Tuscany.</p>

<p>Of Louise's two remaining brothers, one, Archduke
Peter, serves in the Austrian army as Colonel of the Thirty-second
Infantry, while Archduke Henry is Master of Horse
in the Sixth Bavarian Dragoons.</p>

<p>Only one of Louise's four sisters is married, the oldest,
Anna, now Princess Johannes of Hohenlohe-Bartenstein.</p>

<p>The unmarried sisters are Archduchesses Margareta
(31 years old), Germana (28 years old), Agnes (22 years
old).</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Mother Comes of Mentally Tainted Stock</i></p>

<p>Louise's mother, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Princess Alice of Parma, is the
only surviving sister of the late Duke Robert, who left
twenty children, all living, and of whom eighteen or nineteen
are either imbeciles or raving lunatics, the present
head of the house, Duke Henry, belonging to the first category
of mentally unsound.</p>

<p>Louise's first cousin, Prince Elias of Parma, the sev<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>enth
son, is accounted sound, but Elias's sister, Zita (the
twelfth child), developed maniacal tendencies since her marriage
to Archduke Karl Francis Joseph, heir-presumptive
to the crown of Austria-Hungary.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Francis Joseph's Autocratic Rule</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Louise Formerly in Line of Austrian Succession</i></p>

<p>Louise was in the line of the Austrian succession until,
upon her marriage to the Crown Prince of Saxony (1891),
she officially renounced her birthrights.</p>

<p>Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary is Louise's
grand-uncle as well as chief of the imperial family of
Austria, the royal family of Hungary, the Grand-ducal family
of Tuscany (now extinct as far as the title goes), and
of the Estes, which is the Ducal Line of Modena, extinct
in the male line. Finally he is recognized as chief by the
ducal family of Parma, descendants of the Spanish Hapsburgs.</p>

<p>Emperor Francis Joseph rules all the Hapsburgers, Austrian,
Hungarian, and those of Tuscany, of Este, of Modena
and Parma, autocratically, his word being law in the
family. Even titles conferred by birth can be taken away
by him, as exemplified in the case of Louise and her brother
Leopold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Royal Saxons</i></p>

<p>As a member of the Austrian imperial family, the Hapsburgers,
founded in 883, Louise ranked higher than her
husband, the Crown Prince of the petty Kingdom of Saxony,
whose claim to the royal title dates from 1806,&mdash;a gift
of the Emperor Napoleon.</p>

<p>She married Frederick Augustus November 21, 1891,
while the latter's uncle reigned as King Albert of Saxony
(1873 to 1902).</p>

<p>Louise's father-in-law, up to then known as Prince
George, succeeded his brother June 19, 1902. He was then
a widower and his family consisted of:</p>

<p>Princess Mathilde, unmarried,</p>

<p>The Crown Prince Frederick Augustus, husband of
Louise,</p>

<p>Princess Marie-Josepha, wife of Archduke Otho of
Austria,</p>

<p>Prince Johann George, at that time married to Isabelle
of W&uuml;rttemberg, and</p>

<p>Prince Max. The latter subsequently shelved his
title and entered the Church July 26, 1896. He is
a professor of canonical law and slated for a German
bishopric.</p>

<p>At the time of Prince George's ascension, there was
also living the late King Albert's widow, Queen Caroline,
<i>n&eacute;e</i> Princess of Wasa, since dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Marchesa Rapallo, <i>n&eacute;e</i> Princess Elizabeth of Saxony,
is a sister of the late King George.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Louise and Her Father-in-Law</i></p>

<p>During King George's short reign, Louise ran away
from the Saxon court, end of November, 1902.</p>

<p>On February 11, 1903, divorce was pronounced against
her by a special court assembled by King George.</p>

<p>Louise was adjudged the guilty party and deprived of
the name and style of Crown Princess of Saxony. As previously
(January 27) the Austrian Emperor had forbidden
her to use the name and title of Austrian Archduchess
and Imperial and royal Princess, Louise would have been
nameless but for the rank and title of Countess Montiguoso,
conferred upon her by King George.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Louise's Alimony Conditional</i></p>

<p>At the same time Louise accepted from the court of
Saxony a considerable monthly allowance on condition that
"she undertake nothing liable to compromise the reigning
family, either by criticism or story, either by word, deed
or in writing."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Frederick Augustus, King</i></p>

<p>Upon his father's death, Frederick Augustus succeeded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
King George October 15, 1904. He is now forty-seven
years old, while Louise is forty-two.</p>

<p>The King of Saxony has six children by Louise, three
boys and three girls, five born in wedlock, the youngest
born without wedlock. The children born in wedlock
are:</p>

<p>
The present Crown Prince, born 1893.<br />
Frederick Christian, likewise born in 1893.<br />
Ernest, born 1896.<br />
Margaret, born 1900.<br />
And Marie Alix, born 1901.<br />
</p>

<p>The youngest Princess of Saxony, so called, Anna
Monica, was born by Louise more than six months after
she left her husband and nearly three months after her
divorce.</p>

<p>Louise desired to retain Anna Monica in her own custody,
but though the child's fathership is in doubt, to say
the least, Frederick Augustus insisted upon the little one's
transference to his care.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Allowance Raised and a Further Threat</i></p>

<p>King Frederick Augustus raised Louise's allowance to
$12,000 per year, "which alimony ceases if the said Countess
Montiguoso shall commit, either personally, directly or
indirectly, any act in writing or otherwise liable to injure
the reputation of King Frederick Augustus or members of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
the royal family of Saxony, or if the said Countess Montiguoso
contributes to any such libellous publication in any
manner or form."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>The Divorce of Royal Couple Illegal</i></p>

<p>After divorce was pronounced against her, Louise declined
to accept the decree of the court, pronouncing the
proceedings illegal on the ground that both she and husband
are Catholics and that the Roman Catholic Church,
under no circumstances, recognizes divorce. Her protest
gained importance from the fact that her marriage to Frederick
Augustus was solemnized by the rites of the Roman
Catholic Church. The Saxon court, on the other hand,
justified its own decision by basing same on a certain civil
ceremony entered into by Louise and Frederick Augustus
previous to the church marriage.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Louise Marries a Second Time</i></p>

<p>When Louise realized in the course of years that Frederick
Augustus would not take her back, she changed her
mind as to the illegality of her divorce and married, September
25, 1907, Enrico Toselli, an Italian composer and
pianist of small reputation.</p>

<p>This marriage was performed civilly. They have one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
child, a boy, about whose custody the now legally separated
parents have instituted several actions in law. The boy
has now been allotted to the care of Toselli's mother.</p>


<p class="center"><i>King Did Not Marry Again</i></p>

<p>King Frederick Augustus, though by the laws of Saxony
and Germany allowed to contract a second marriage,
has not availed himself of the license, probably in deference
to the wishes of the Vatican. At the same time he spurned
all of Louise's attempts at reconciliation, the most dramatic
of which was her <i>coup de t&ecirc;te</i> of December, 1904, when
she went to Dresden "to see her children," was arrested at
the palace gate and conducted out of the kingdom by high
police officials.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />


<p class="center"><i>Other Royalties Mentioned in This Volume</i></p>

<p>Louise refers, in her Diary, to the Kaiser as "cousin."
If there be any relationship between her and William, it is
that imposed by the Saxon marriage, Saxon princes and
princesses having frequently intermarried with the royal
and princely Hohenzollerns, despite the differences of religion.
There are four courts of Saxony despite that of
Dresden: Weimar, Meiningen, Altenburg and Coburg and
Gotha.</p>

<p>The latter duchy's ruler, Karl Eduard, is of English<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
descent, a son of the late Duke of Albany. Hence, Louise's
cousinship with Victoria Melita, sometime Grand Duchess
of Hesse, now Grand Duchess Kyril of Russia.</p>

<p>Of course, Louise is closely related to all the Orleans
and Bourbons.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, who died on the
scaffold at Paris, October 16, 1793, she calls her great-grand-aunt
and namesake, claiming, at the same time, most
of the Kings and princes of France of the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries as relatives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span></p>

CROWN PRINCESS
OF SAXONY</h2>

<h4>MOTHERHOOD</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A sterile Royal Family once fruitful&mdash;Diary true record of self&mdash;Long
legs of Countess Solms&mdash;A child only because he can't
help it&mdash;Wet nurse to Socialist brat&mdash;Royal permit for nursing&mdash;Royal
negligee talk&mdash;A Saxon failing.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Castle Wachwitz</span>, <i>February 17, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I did my duty towards the Saxons. I gave them a
Prince. The Royal House ought to be grateful to me:&mdash;I
am helping to perpetuate it. Who would, if I didn't?
My sister-in-law, Princess Mathilde, is an old maid. The
other, Maria Josepha, as sterile as Sarah was before she
reached the nineties. This applies also to Isabelle, the wife
of brother-in-law, John-George. And Prince Max, tired of
ballet girls, is about to take the soutane.</p>

<p>There is just one more royal Saxon princess, Elizabeth,
and she succeeded in having children neither with her hus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>band
<i>de jure</i>, the late Duke of Genoa, nor with her husband-lover,
Marquis Rapallo.</p>

<p>Louise, then, is the sole living hope of the royal Saxons
that, only 160 years ago, boasted of a sovereign having
three hundred and fifty-two children to his credit, among
them not a few subsequently accounted geniuses. Augustus,
the Physical Strong (1670 to 1733), was the happy
father, the <i>Mar&eacute;shal de</i> Saxe one of his numerous gifted
offspring.</p>

<p>Alas, since then the House of Wettin has declined not
in numbers only.</p>

<p>Poor baby is burdened with ten names in honor of so
many ancestors. Why, in addition, they want to call him
"Maria" I cannot for the life of me understand, for there
never was a Saxon princess or queen that amounted to a
row of pins.</p>

<p>I wonder whether they will say the same of me after
the crown of the Wettiners descended upon my brow.
Those so inclined should consult these papers ere they begin
throwing stones, for my Diary is intended to contain
my innermost thoughts, my ambitions, my promises for the
future, <i>Myself</i>, and let no one judge me by what I say
other than what is recorded here.</p>

<p>These pages are my Father Confessor. I confess to
myself,&mdash;what a woman in my position says to members of
her family or official and semi-official persons&mdash;her servants,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
so to speak&mdash;doesn't signify, to borrow a phrase from my
good cousin, the Kaiser Wilhelm.</p>

<p>Father-in-law George tells me to trust no one but him,
my husband, and Frederick Augustus's sisters, cousins and
aunts, and to rely on prayer only, yet, stubborn as nature
made me, I prefer respectable white paper to my sweet
relatives.</p>

<p>Up to now my most ambitious literary attempts were
intimate letters to my brother Leopold, the "Black Sheep."
As I now start in writing letters to myself, it occurs to me
that my worse self may be corresponding with my better
self, or vice versa. If I was only a poet like Countess
Solms, but, dear, no. All real bluestockings are ugly and
emaciated. Solms is both, and her legs are as long and as
thin as those of Diana, my English hunter.</p>

<p>I think this Diary business will be quite amusing,&mdash;at
any rate, it will be more so than the conversation of my
ladies. Ah, those ladies of the court of Saxony! If they
would only talk of anything else but orphans, sisters of
charity and ballet girls. The latter always have one foot
in Hades, while you can see the wings grow on the backs
of the others.</p>

<p>When the von Schoenberg struts in, peacock fashion,
and announces "his royal Highness did himself the honor
to soil his bib," I sometimes stare at her, not comprehending
at the moment, and the fact that she is talking of my baby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
only gradually comes to mind. Isn't it ridiculous that a
little squalling bit of humanity, whom the accident of birth
planted in a palace, is royalty first and all the time, and a
child only because he can't help it?</p>

<p>As for me, I am a woman and mother first, and my
child is an animated lump of flesh and blood&mdash;<i>my</i> flesh and
blood&mdash;first and all the time. Of course, when baby came
I wanted to nurse it. You should have seen Frederick
Augustus's face. If I had proposed to become a wet-nurse
to some "socialist brat" he couldn't have been more astonished.
Yet my great ancestress, the Empress Maria Theresa,
nursed her babies "before a parquet of proletarians,"
at the theatre and at reviews, and thought nothing of giving
the breast to a poor foundling left in the park of Schoenbrunn.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus recovered his speech after a while&mdash;though
he never says anything that would seem to require
reflection, he always acts the deep thinker. "Louise,"
he mumbled reproachfully,&mdash;"what will his Majesty
say?"</p>

<p>"I thought you were the father of the child," I remarked
innocently.</p>

<p>"No levity where the King is concerned," he corrected
poor me. "You know very well that for an act of this
kind a royal permit must be previously obtained."</p>

<p>Followed a long pause to give his mental apparatus time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to think some more. Then: "And, besides, it will hurt
your figure."</p>

<p>"Augusta Victoria" (the German Empress) "nursed
half a dozen children, and her <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> is still much admired,"
I insisted.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus paid no attention to this argument.
"Anyhow, I don't want the doctors to examine your breast
daily," he said with an air of mixed sentimentality and
brusqueness.</p>

<p>These were not his own words, though. My husband,
not content with calling a spade a spade, invariably uses
the nastiest terms in the dictionary of debauchery. When
he tells me of his love adventures before marriage it's always
"I bagged that girl," or "I made something tender out
of her," just as a hunter talks of game or a leg of venison.</p>

<p>He doesn't want to be rude; he is so without knowing
it. His indelicacy would be astounding in a man born on
the steps of the throne, if the Princes of this royal house
were not all inclined that way.</p>

<p>Two weeks after my accouchement George and Isabelle
called. Though brother and sister-in-law, we are not
at all on terms of intimacy. Frederick Augustus made
some remarks of a personal nature that sent all the blood
to my head; Isabelle seemed to enjoy my discomfort, but
George had the decency to go to the window and comment
on the dirty boots of a guard lieutenant just entering the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
courtyard. Frederick Augustus thought he had made a
hit with Isabelle and applauded his own effort with a loud
guffaw, while pounding his thighs, which seems to give him
particular satisfaction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SWEET FAMILY</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Husband loving, but family nasty&mdash;Money considerations&mdash;Brutal
caresses in public&mdash;Pests in the family&mdash;Awful serenity&mdash;Meddle
with angels' or devils' affairs&mdash;Father-in-law's gritty
kiss.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Castle Wachwitz</span>, <i>February 24, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I have been married some fifteen months and I love
my husband. He is kind, not too inquisitive and passionate.
I have better claims to domestic happiness than most of my
royal sisters on or near the thrones of Europe. Of course
when I married into the Saxon royal family I expected to
be treated with ill-concealed enmity. Wasn't I young and
handsome? Reason enough for the old maids and childless
wives, my new sweet relatives, to detest me.</p>

<p>Wasn't I poor? I brought little with me and my presence
entailed a perpetual expense. Now in royal families
money is everything, or nearly so, and the newcomer that
eats but doesn't increase the family fortune is regarded as
an interloper.</p>

<p>If I hadn't "<i>made good</i>," that is if, in due time, I
hadn't become a mother, my position among the purse-proud,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
rapacious and narrow-minded Wettiners would have become
wellnigh intolerable. But I proved myself a <i>Holstein</i>. I
rose superior to Queen Carola, who never had a child, and
to Maria, Mathilda, Isabelle and Elizabeth, who either
couldn't or didn't. But, to my mind, acting the <i>cow</i> for
the benefit of the race did not invite stable manners.</p>

<p>I wasn't used to them. They hadn't figured in the
dreams of my girlhood. I thought love less robust. I
didn't expect to be squeezed before my ladies. Even the
best beloved husband shouldn't take liberties with his wife's
waist in the parlor.</p>

<p>And Frederick Augustus's negligee talk is no less
offensive than his manner of laying loving hands on my
person. As a rule, he treats me like a third-row dancing
girl that goes to petition the manager for a place nearer
the footlights. There is no limit to his familiarities or to
the license of his conversation. "<i>Fine wench</i>" is a term of
affection he likes to bestow on his future queen; indeed,
one of the less gross. He has the weakness to like epithets
that, I am told, gentlemen sometimes use in their clubs, but
never towards a mistress they half-way respect.</p>

<p>My father-in-law, Prince George, is a pest of another
kind. While Frederick Augustus is jovial and rude, George
is rude and serene of a serenity that would make a Grand
Inquisitor look gay.</p>

<p>One of my famous ancestresses, the Princess-Palatine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
sister-in-law of Louis the Fourteenth, once boxed the
Dauphin's ears for a trick he played on her, by putting his
upright thumb in the centre of an armchair which her royal
highness meant to sit on.</p>

<p>Whenever I behold George's funereal visage, I long to
repeat the Dauphin's undignified offense. I would like to
see this royal parcel of melancholy jump and dance; change
that ever-frowning and mournful aspect of his. Indeed, I
would like to treat him to one of the anecdotes that made
the Duchess de Berri explode with laughter.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus lives in deadly fear of him, and
never gets his hair cut without first considering whether
his father will approve or not. George isn't happy unless
he renders other people unhappy. I actually believe he
would rather meddle with the angels' or devils' affairs than
say his prayers, though he is a bigot of the most advanced
stripe.</p>

<p>Sometimes when the itch for meddling has hold of
him, he cites all the married princes of the royal house
and lectures them on the wickedness of having no children,
winding up by commanding each one to explain, in detail,
his failure to have offspring.</p>

<p>Of course, these gentlemen put the blame on their
wives, whereupon the ladies are forthwith summoned to
be threatened and cajoled.</p>

<p>Prince George had the great goodness to approve of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
my baby and to congratulate me, also to set me up as an
example for Isabelle. When I return to Dresden I shall

<p>Prince Max came unexpectedly. He is studying for the
priesthood and looks more sour than his father even. I was
in bed, nursing a sick headache, but presuming upon his
future clerical dignity, he walked in without ceremony and
sat down on a chair near my bed. Then he raised his hands
in prayer and announced that he had come to assist in my
devotions.</p>

<p>"Forget that I am your brother-in-law and cousin," he
said; "tell me what's in your heart, Louise, and I will pray
to the good God for thee."</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself," I replied, "I have a court

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Castle Wachwitz</span>, <i>March 11, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>It occurs to me that, if this is intended as a record of
my life&mdash;somewhat after the fashion of the <i>Margravine</i>
of Bayreuth's Memoirs&mdash;I ought to tell about my girlhood.</p>

<p>Let me admit at once that my marriage to the Crown
Prince of Saxony was, politically speaking, a stroke of
good luck. My father, the Grand-duke of Tuscany, had
been deprived of land and crown ten years before I was
born, and, though he likes to pose as a sovereign, he is, as
a matter of fact, a mere private gentleman of limited resources,
whom the head of the family, the Austrian Emperor,
may coax or browbeat at his sweet pleasure. If
papa had been able to save his thronelet, I have no doubt he
would be a most agreeable man, open-handed and eager to
enjoy life, but instead of making the best of a situation
over which he has no control, he is forever fretting about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
his lost dignities and about "his dear people" that don't
care a snap for his love and affection. This makes him a
trying person to get along with,&mdash;mention a king or prince
in the full enjoyment of power, and father gets melancholy
and calls Victor Emanuel, the second of his name, a brigand.</p>

<p>He seldom or never visits his <i>confr&egrave;res</i> in the capitals
of Europe, but when I was a girl our gloomy palace at
Salzburg saw much of the ghosts of decaying royalty. The
Dukes of Modena and Parma, the King of Hanover, the
<i>Kurfurst</i> of Hesse, the King of Naples and other monarchs
and toy-monarchs that were handed their walking papers
by sovereigns mightier than themselves, visited us off and
on, filling the air with lamentations and cursing their fate.</p>

<p>And, like papa, all these <i>ex'es</i> are ready to fly out of
their very skins the moment they notice the smallest breach
of etiquette concerning their august selves. If they had
the power, the Imperial Highnesses would execute any man
that called them "Royal Highness," while the Royal Highnesses
would be pleased to send to the gallows persons addressing
them as "Highness" only.</p>

<p>And papa has other troubles, and the greatest of them,
lack of money. Poverty in private life must be hard enough,
but a poor king, obliged to keep up the pretense of a court,
is to be pitied indeed.</p>

<p>Add to what I have said, father's share of domestic
unhappiness. Mother is a Bourbon of Parma, serious-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>minded and
hard like my father-in-law, and almost as much
of a religious fanatic.</p>

<p>Oh, how we children suffered by the piety of our
mother. There were eight of us, myself the oldest of five
girls, and seven years older than my sister Anna. Yet this
baby, as soon as she could walk, was obliged to rise, like
myself, at five o'clock summer and winter to go to the
chapel and pray. The chapel was lighted only by a few
wax candles and, of course, was unheated like the corridors
of the palace. And like them it was paved with stones.
Many a chilblain I carried away from kneeling on those
granite flags.</p>

<p>And the stupidity of the thing! Instead of saying our
prayers we murmured and protested, and as soon as we
were old enough we slipped portions of novels in our prayer-books,
which we read while mass was said. That trick
was not unfraught with danger though, for mother's spies
were always after us, and the bad light made reading difficult.</p>

<p>I am sure that if mother had found us out, she would
have whipped us within an inch of our lives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h4>A FIERCE DISCIPLINARIAN</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Diamonds used to punish children&mdash;Face object of attacks&mdash;Grunting

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Castle Wachwitz</span>, <i>April 1, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Nothing of consequence happened since my last entry,
and I continue the story of my girlhood.</p>

<p>Her Imperial Highness, my pious mother, had a terrible
way of punishing her children. The face of the culprit
was invariably the object of her attacks. She hit us with
the flat of her bony hand, rendered more terrible by innumerable
rings. The sharp diamonds cut into the flesh
and usually made the blood flow freely.</p>

<p>The court chaplain at Salzburg was a peasant's boy
without manners or breeding of any kind. While the
least violation of etiquette or politeness on the children's
part was punished by a box on the ear, or by
withholding the next meal, mother overlooked the swinishness
of the chaplain simply because he wore a black
coat.</p>

<p>One of the chaplain's most offensive habits was to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
grunt and snort when eating. On one occasion my brother
Leopold gave a somewhat exaggerated imitation of these
disgusting practices at table, whereupon mother, blind with
fury, for she thought a priest could do no wrong, struck
Leopold in the face, causing the blood to gush from his
lacerated cheek.</p>

<p>Father immediately rose from table and savagely turning
upon mother said, "Understand, Madame, that as a
sovereign and head of the family I will have no one punished
in my presence. If I think punishment necessary, I
will inflict it myself in a dignified way."</p>

<p>Mother immediately began to cry. She always had a
flood of tears ready when father offered the slightest reprimand.
Afterwards she upbraided father and us, the children.
If it were not for her incessant prayers, she said,
and for the Christian life she was leading, God would have
destroyed the Tuscans long ago, and she wasn't sure that
either of us would attain Paradise except for her intercession
with the Almighty.</p>

<p>This and similar scenes and incidents disgusted me with
religion early in life. Myself and all my brothers and sisters
hated the very sight of the court chaplain who licked
our mother's boots, while heaping punishments and indignities
upon us.</p>

<p>At one time my brother Leopold didn't know his
catechism. "I will teach your Imperial Highness to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
skip your lessons," said the court chaplain. "Kneel before
me and read the passage over ten times as a punishment."</p>

<p>Leopold promptly answered: "I won't."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will, Imperial Highness, for such are my
orders," cried the court chaplain.</p>

<p>Leopold said doggedly, "I kneel before the altar and
before the Emperor, if he demands it, not before such as
you."</p>

<p>"Suppose I call on your Imperial Highness's mother and
ask her to forbid you to mount a horse for a month or so?"
queried our tormentor.</p>

<p>Horseback riding was Leopold's chief pleasure, and the
chaplain had no sooner launched his threat, when Leopold
opened the window and apparently jumped out. As the
school-room was situated in the third story, the teacher
thought his pupil dead on the pavement below, but Leopold
was merely hanging on to the stone coping and shutters.
That gave him the whip hand over the teacher. "I will
let go if you don't promise not to inform mother," demanded
the twelve-year-old boy.</p>

<p>"I promise, only come in," moaned the teacher.</p>

<p>"Promise furthermore there shall be no punishment
whatever for what I did and said."</p>

<p>"None whatever, your Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>"Swear it on the cross."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The chaplain did as ordered and Leopold crawled back
to safety.</p>

<p>Leopold is a good deal like me, and has been in hot
water more or less all his life.</p>

<p>When I was a girl of fifteen, he defended my honor
at the risk of the fearful punishments my mother had in
store for those children that wouldn't buckle down to the
chaplain, but that is so sad a chapter of my girlhood days
I cannot bring myself to put it down today.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h4>LEOPOLD DEFENDS MY HONOR AT HIS PERIL</h4>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Castle Wachwitz</span>, <i>April 2, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I want to finish with evil recollections. Maybe I will
be able to forget them, when I have done with this narrative.
My mother, as pointed out, had more confidence in
our rascally court chaplain than in her own children, and
was far more concerned about the chaplain's dignity than
ours. She never hesitated to doubt her children's veracity,
but regarded all the chaplain said as gospel truth.</p>

<p>About two weeks before Easter, 1885, the time when I
was just budding into young womanhood, the chaplain
began to pay me a great deal of attention. The lessons he
gave me to learn were insignificant compared with those of
my brothers and sisters, and it mattered not whether I came
to school prepared or otherwise. The strict disciplinarian
had all of a sudden turned lenient. He began to pat my
hair, to give me friendly taps on the shoulder, and never
took his eyes off me. I was too young and innocent to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the true significance of his strange behavior, but I woke
up suddenly and ran crying to my mother, telling her what
had happened.</p>

<p>"I won't take another lesson from that man, unless my
lady-in-waiting is present," I sobbed.</p>

<p>"You are a malicious, lying, low-minded creature,"
hissed my mother, at the same time striking me in the face
with her big diamonds. "It's mortal sin to throw suspicion
on so holy a man, and I will not have him watched."</p>

<p>I ran out of mother's room crying, intending to go to
papa, but met the boys in the corridor, who told me that
father had just departed for the chase. Then I took Leopold
aside and told him everything. He was half-mad with
rage and was hardly able to articulate when he rushed to
mother's room demanding protection for me.</p>

<p>"I will protect the holy man instead," answered my
fanatic mother. "Louise shall be locked in the room
with the chaplain while she has her lesson." And my
mother actually carried out that wicked design inspired by
fanaticism.</p>

<p>Locked in a room with me, the chaplain was sweetness
itself, but for a while at least remained at a distance.
When he attempted to approach me, I seized the burning
kerosene lamp, as Leopold had advised.</p>

<p>"One step more," I cried excitedly, "and I will throw
the lamp in your face."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The coward stood still in his tracks, and began whispering
to me in a hoarse voice things I hardly understood, but
that nevertheless wounded me to the quick. I kept my
hand at the burning lamp during the whole hour and was
ready to faint when the fiend at last left me.</p>

<p>As the door opened, I saw Leopold standing outside,
an enormous dog whip in hand. Without a word he applied
the whip to the chaplain's broad face, lashing him
right and left. The scoundrel offered no resistance, but
fled like the dog he was, Leopold after him through the long
corridors, upstairs and downstairs, through the picture gallery
and the state apartments, lashing him as he ran, the
two of them filling the palace with cries of rage and pain.
Only the fact that Leopold stumbled over a footstool,
enabled the chaplain to reach his room alive, where he
barricaded himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>If my Diary ever fell into plebeian hands, I suppose
such stories as the above would be branded as rank exaggerations.</p>

<p>A Queen endangering life and health of her children
by a form of punishment otherwise known only in the prize
ring.</p>

<p>An Imperial Highness using her diamonds to graft
scars on the cheeks of a little girl!</p>

<p>Royal children beaten worse than dogs, deprived of
sleep, subjected to cold and damp and, withal, given over,
bound hand and foot, so to speak, to the tender mercies of
low-minded, unworthy, and even dangerous persons without
manners or education.</p>

<p>And, to cap the climax, a Royal maid in the first blush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of budding womanhood grossly repulsed and physically attacked
when she appeals to her mother for protection; that
child locked in a room with her would-be ravisher and
obliged to defend her honor by a threat of murder.</p>

<p>Only the uninitiated&mdash;men and women living outside
the pale of royal courts&mdash;will deem such things impossible.
Let me tell these happy ignoramuses that all through the
nineteenth century the princes and princesses of Europe
were brought up to the tune of the whip and of physical
and mental humiliation. It was the fashion.</p>

<p>The only eminent monarch of the immediate past&mdash;Frederick
the Great&mdash;was all but flayed alive by his father
when a boy and young man,&mdash;emulate the second King of
Prussia's brutalities and your offspring will be destined for
greatness, argued princes.</p>

<p>The first Emperor William of Germany had a gentle
mother, my famous namesake; he was always a gentleman.
The Russian Czars, Paul, Nicholas I, and Alexander
III, were brought up with the knout, their preceptors used
the boys at their sweet pleasure. The first turned out a
madman; the second a brute; the third his people's executioner.</p>

<p>Czar Paul would run a mile to cane a soldier who
had a speck of dust on his boots. My grand-uncle, Emperor
Francis Joseph of Austria, sometimes travels tens of
miles to box the ears of a member of his family.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Francis Joseph had a cruel bringing up.</p>

<p>At the Royal Library in Berlin I saw the manuscript
of <i>Les M&eacute;moires de ma vie: la princesse de Prusse, Frederice
Sophie Wilhelmine, qui epousa le Margrave de Bayreuth</i>,&mdash;the
original, unedited save by the corrections of
the authoress. A good many passages of this "most terrible
indictment of royalty" reminded me of home. There is
even a parallel, or a near-parallel, of my own case just
recorded. The Princess Wilhelmina's all-powerful governess
was Madame Leti, who pummelled the child "as if
she had been her mother." This Leti was undoubtedly a
Sadist; to inflict torture, to practice refined cruelties was
a joy to her. Not content with whipping the little girl, she
added, shortly before her dismissal, some poisonous matter
to Wilhelmina's wash water "that gnawed the skin and
made my face all coppery and inflamed my eyes." This
species of wickedness, at last, resulted in the discharge of
Leti, "but she decided to leave me a few souvenirs in the
shape of fisticuffs and kicks. She had told my mother that
I was suffering from nose bleed and punched my nose whenever
she was unobserved. During the last week of her
stay at the palace I sometimes bled like an ox, and my
arms and legs were blue, green and yellow from her kicks
and cuffs. I am sure if she could have broken my legs
with impunity, she would not have hesitated a moment to
do so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>History and the court gossip of the day afford plenty
of precedents for what happened to me and my brothers
and sisters in Salzburg. Indeed, Prince Albert, Consort of
the late Queen Victoria, was the only royal father of the
first half of the century that used the rod in moderation.
To my mind that is one of the reasons why English
kings and princes are so far superior to the Continental
kind.</p>

<p>But to return to Salzburg.</p>

<p>Leopold had it all his own way for a quarter of an
hour, as none of the servants would interfere in favor of
the hated chaplain and mother was engaged in her oratory
in a far away part of the castle. So my brother kicked in
the door and went for the cowering brute again, raining
stripes on every part of his bloated body, alternately using
the whip and the whip-end. Undoubtedly Leopold would
have killed him then and there if his boy's strength had
not given out. He left him more dead than alive, bleeding
and moaning.</p>

<p>I will never forget the spectacle when Leopold came
down the stairs after leaving the chaplain's room. I and
my brothers and sisters were huddled together behind our
ladies in the blue ante-chamber. A dozen or more lackeys
stood in the corridor, whispering.</p>

<p>Leopold's face was deathly pale as he descended the
stairs, and blood was dripping from his whip, reddening the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
white linen runners protecting the carpet. He wore his
army uniform, that should have saved him from violence
at any rate. At that moment I prayed my sincerest that
father would come home. I would have thrown myself on
my knees and told everything, servants or no servants.
But mother came instead.</p>

<p>She was fully informed and she sprang upon poor Leopold
like a tigress, knocking him from one end of the corridor
to the other with her diamond-mailed fist. It was
terrible, and all of us children cried aloud with terror. But
the more we cried and the more we begged for mercy, the
harder were the blows mother rained upon poor Leopold's
face and head. His blood spattered over the white enameled
banisters and doors until finally he was dragged out
of my mother's clutches by an old footman who placed
his broad back between the Imperial Highness and her
victim.</p>

<p>Now, it was the rule in our house that the whipped
child had to ask our mother's forgiveness for putting her
to the trouble of wielding the terrible back of her
hand.</p>

<p>Six weeks Leopold stayed at Salzburg after the scene
described, and daily my mother urged him to beg her forgiveness.
The boy stood stockstill on these occasions, never
twitching a muscle of his face and never saying a word in
reply. During all these six weeks he waited on mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
morning, noon and night, according to ceremony, but never
a word escaped him, never did he look in her direction unless
actually forced to do so. He played the deaf and
dumb to perfection.</p>

<p>Father must have thought that Leopold got enough
punishment, for he never mentioned the matter to him and
forbade the servants to even allude to the court chaplain.
Mother, on her part, placed the chaplain in charge of two
skilled surgeons and sent every little while to inquire how
he was doing.</p>

<p>On the third day she said to my father at table, that she
was going to pay a visit to the court chaplain.</p>

<p>"I forbid your Imperial Highness to see that dog,"
said my father in an icy voice that brooked no reply. "I
will have his carcass thrown out of here as soon as his
condition permits."</p>

<p>That was the only time I heard father speak like a
sovereign and man.</p>

<p>That Leopold nearly killed the scoundrel, as he promised
to do, is evident from the fact that the court chaplain
lay in the castle three weeks before he could be transported
to a monastery. Some monks&mdash;for none of the
servants would lend a helping hand&mdash;carried him away by
night and none of the children ever saw or heard of our
tormentor again.</p>

<p>The only sorry reminder of the episode is the estrange<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>ment
of Leopold and our mother. Though mother tried her
hardest to win back the boy's confidence and affection, he
remained an iceberg towards her, ceremonious but cold,
polite but wholly indifferent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Castle Wachwitz</span>, <i>April 25, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>A change of scene. I was eighteen and my parents
were anxious to get a husband for me. Royalty marries
off its princes at an early age to keep them out of mischief;
its princesses as soon as a profitable suitor turns up or can
be secured by politics, diplomacy, the exercise of parental
wits or the powerful influence of the head of the House.</p>

<p>Sister Anna, now Princess John of Hohenlohe, myself
and mother were invited to Vienna. It was my introduction
to royal pomp and circumstance. The <i>Hofburg</i>, our
town lodging, seemed to me the first and also the last cry
in sumptuousness&mdash;all that was beautiful and expensive in
days gone by is there, and all that is new and desirable is
there, too; Schoenbrunn, the Imperial summer residence, is
a dream of loveliness wedded to grandeur. Between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Emperor and my mother and between her and the numerous
archduchesses and archdukes every second word uttered
referred to me as the possible wife of someone or
another. And that someone was well dissected as to fortune,
success in life and political exigencies.</p>

<p>Whether he was good-looking or a monkey in face
and figure mattered not. Health, good character, uprightness
didn't count.</p>

<p>Has he expectations for gaining a throne? Will he
be wise enough to retain that throne? What kind of an
establishment will he be able to set up? How long may his
parents live, hanging on to the family fortune?&mdash;These
were the only considerations deemed worthy of discussion.</p>

<p>Three or four of the archduchesses seemed to be acting
as marriage brokers for Ferdinand, just elected hereditary
prince of Bulgaria, whose mother, Princess Clementine, a
daughter of the dethroned King Louis Philippe of France,
was reputed to be rolling in gold.</p>

<p>Leopold irreverently called Ferdinand's partisans "<i>Fillons</i>"
after famous "<i>La Fillon</i>," who supplied the harem
of our jolly ancestor, the Regent of France, Duke of
Orleans, and he insisted that Ferdinand was a <i>Cohen</i>, not
a Coburg. As a matter of fact, Ferdinand's great fortune
is derived from a Kohary, which is Hungarian for Cohen.
The original Kohary was a cattle-dealer, who supplied the
armies of the Allies during the Napoleonic wars. In this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
way he accumulated so much wealth that an impoverished
Coburg prince fell in love with his daughter and made her
his wife, after she exchanged the name of Rebecca for
Antonie and the Mosaic faith for that of Rome.</p>

<p>Young and proud and flippant as I was, Leopold's talk
filled me with hearty contempt for the "Coburger" long
before we were introduced. And as to his ambassador,
who was forever dancing attendance upon me, I hated him.
Yet the Imperial "<i>Fillons</i>" kept up their clatter, and one
fine morning Prince Ferdinand was announced.</p>

<p>He wasn't half bad looking, but struck me as too much
of a mother's-boy. Princess Clementine seemed to decide
everything for him. Anyhow, I wouldn't have him and
he marched off again.</p>

<p>I next reviewed, as another Balkan matrimonial possibility,
Prince Danilo of Montenegro, a small, thin person,
looking like a Jew counter-jumper in holiday dress&mdash;Vienna
"store-clothes."</p>

<p>Danilo spoke the worst <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> French I ever heard
in my life, and I told mother I would rather marry a rich
banker than this crowned idiot. For once she agreed with
me and said his father was only a "mutton-thief," anyhow.</p>

<p>Finally there was talk of King Alexander of Servia,
six years younger than I. Queen Natalie, who a few days
ago celebrated one of her several reunions with ex-King
Milan, spoke feelingly of her "Sasha" to mother, lauding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
him as the best of sons and the most promising of sovereigns,
but the oft-divorced Majesty was less communicative
when mother asked how many millions she would
pass over to Alexander on his marriage day. That settled
"Sasha's" ambitions as far as my hand was concerned.
Marry a Balkan King and the <i>n&eacute;e</i> Keshko holding the purse-strings!
Not for my father's daughter! I didn't want to
marry into a Russian Colonel's family, anyhow. I believe
Queen Natalie's father was a colonel, or was he only a lieutenant-colonel?</p>

<p>These marriage negotiations aside, Anna and myself
had a mighty good time in Vienna (I forgot to say that
Emperor Francis Joseph agreed with me that Danilo and
Alexander were quite impossible and that henceforth Balkan
marriages should be taboo).</p>

<p>"I have ordered a dozen young officers to report for
tonight's dancing," said my Imperial uncle one evening.
"Select from among them your tennis partners, girls."
Baron Cambroy of the Guards was my choice, and a mighty
handsome fellow he is. He seemed pleased when I commanded
him to tennis duty every afternoon during our
stay. He is tall and spare in appearance and I might have
fallen in love with him sooner, but for his dark skin. I
am an Italian and, by way of contrast, prefer blondes to
any other sort of man.</p>

<p>Anna, myself and our ladies bicycled to the tennis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
court every afternoon, and on our way back to the castle
were escorted by the Baron and the other officers.</p>

<p>Trust a girl with a dress reaching an inch below her
knees to find out scandals! On the second day after our
meeting with the Baron, Anna told me that he was the
lover of Draga Maschin, lady-in-waiting to Queen Natalie
of Servia.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Draga was in attendance upon Queen Natalie when
she called on us, a beautiful girl, somewhat too full-bosomed
for an unmarried one, like my great-aunt, Catharine, who
became the wife of that upstart, Jerome Napoleon. At
home we have her picture, and mother, who was rather
skinny as a girl, never failed to point out that it was painted
before Queen Catharine's marriage, despite her voluptuous
bust.</p>

<p>If my Baron was really Draga's beloved, that would
more than half explain mother's puzzle.</p>

<h4>LOVE-MAKING</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The fascinating Baron&mdash;The man's audacity&mdash;Putting the question
boldly&mdash;Real love-making&mdash;<i>Risqu&eacute;</i> stories for royalty.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Castle Wachwitz</span>, <i>May 1, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I am in love but, like a prudent virgin, I admitted the
fact to myself only shortly before we departed for Salzburg.
After I put several hundred miles between me and
my fascinating Baron, all's well again.</p>

<p>My first love, and it was the man's audacity that won
the day!</p>

<p>Imagine an Imperial Highness, decidedly attractive,
eighteen, and no tigress by any means, wheeling at the
side of a mere lieutenant who has nothing but his pay to
bless himself with and nothing but good looks to recommend
him. And, as before stated, he wasn't even my
style.</p>

<p>Anna pedalled ahead some twenty-five paces; our ladies
wheezed and snorted that many behind. This devil of
a lieutenant took a chance.</p>

<p>"Imperial Highness," he commenced, "I wager you
don't know what love is."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the one theme I was aching for, scenting, as I
did, the odor of forbidden things. Never before had I the
opportunity.</p>

<p>"R-e-a-l love," he insisted.</p>

<p>"Do you blame me?" I asked, vixen-like. "Would be
a poor specimen of Guard officer who didn't know more
about real love than a mere girl of eighteen and a princess
at that."</p>

<p>"Will your Imperial Highness allow me to explain?"
This, oh so insinuatingly, from the gay seducer.</p>

<p>"Why not?" I asked, with the air of a <i>rou&eacute;</i> and hating
myself for blushing like a poppy&mdash;I felt it.</p>

<p>"Charmed to enlighten you&mdash;with your Imperial Highness's
permission," whispered the Baron, his knee crowding
mine as he drew nearer on his wheel.</p>

<p>"Explain away."</p>

<p>"Not until I have your Imperial Highness's express
command and your promise not to get angry if I should
offend."</p>

<p>Anna, always an <i>enfant terrible</i> and invariably in the
way, was waiting for us in the shadow of a tree and now
rode by the Baron's side. She had evidently heard part
of our conversation.</p>

<p>"Permission and pardon granted beforehand," she
cried. "Go ahead."</p>

<p>The Baron looked at me, and not to be outdone by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
parcel of impudence in short petticoats, I said carelessly:
"Oh, tell. I command."</p>

<p>The Baron began to stroke his moustache and then
related a story of Napoleon and our ancestress Marie
Louise, the Austrian Archduchess, not found in school
books.</p>

<p>On the day before her entry into Paris, he said, and
when they were destined to meet for the first time, Napoleon
waylaid his bride-to-be at Courcelles and without
ceremony entered her carriage. They rushed past villages,
through towns <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> and at last, at nine o'clock in the
evening, reached the palace of Compi&egrave;gne. There the
Emperor cut short the addresses of welcome, presentations
and compliments, and taking Marie Louise by the hand
conducted her to his private apartments. Next morning
they had breakfast in bed. The marriage ceremony took
place a few days later.</p>

<p>"That's love," said the Baron, shooting significant
glances at me.</p>

<p>"Henry <i>Quatre</i> did the same to Marie de Medici&mdash;an
Italian like you, Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>Anna didn't know what to make of it, and as for me,
my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth.</p>

<p>The impudent fellow seems to have misinterpreted our
silence, for, brazen like the <i>Duc de</i> Richelieu, who boasted
of sleeping in the beds of queens, he continued:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Catharine the Great, too, knew what love was. One
fine afternoon when she wasn't a day older than you, Imperial
Highness, she looked out of the window of her room
at Castle Peterhof. In the garden below a sentinel, very
handsome, very Herculean, very brave, was pacing up and
down. Catharine, then Imperial Grand-duchess and only
just married, made a sign to the soldier. The giant, abandoning
his rifle, jumped below the window and Catharine
jumped onto his shoulders from the second story.</p>

<p>"That's real love," concluded the Baron.</p>

<p>Anna got frightened and fled down the avenue, but I
had the weakness to remain at the Baron's side until we
reached the palace.</p>

<p>Alas, Frederick Augustus wasn't as good a talker as
the Baron.</p>

<h4>MY POPULARITY RENDERS GEORGE DYSPEPTIC</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The Cudgel-Majesty&mdash;Prince George's intrigues&mdash;No four-horse
coach for Princess&mdash;Popular demonstration in my favor&mdash;"All-highest"
displeasure.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>September 1, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I haven't lived up to my promise to keep a daily record,
or even a weekly one. Those tales of my girlhood
days disgusted me with diary keeping as far as my early
experiences at home went and I reflected that many of
the subsequent happenings in my life might be safer in the
shrine of memory, than spread over the pages of a blank-book,
even though no one sees it and I carry its golden
key on a chain around my neck.</p>

<p>We are back in the capital now and things are moving.
Great doings had been planned for our reception, for the
re-entry of the little prince, my baby, and his mother who
is expected to give another child to Saxony at the end of
the year. Two babies in one year! I am going to beat
the German Empress, and if Wilhelm doesn't send me a
medal I will cut him dead the next time I see him!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, about that reception. Flags, triumphal arches,
speeches by the burgo-master, white-robed virgins at the
station and all that sort of thing!</p>

<p>But Father-in-law George said "no." Anything that
gives joy to others goes against his royal grain, gives him
politico-economic dyspepsia. He doesn't want me to be
popular,&mdash;neither me, nor Frederick Augustus, nor the
baby.</p>

<p>George will be the next king, and if the Dresdeners
or the Saxons want to "<i>Hoch the King</i>," they must "<i>Hoch</i>"
George. They MUST. "It's their damned duty," says
George the Pious, who never blasphemes on his own account,
but allows himself some license concerning his subjects.
His attitude recalls the story told of Frederick William
the First of Prussia, whose appearance on the streets
of Berlin used to cause passers-by to run to save their
back. Upon one occasion His Majesty caught one of
these fugitives, and whacking him over the head with his
Spanish reed, cried angrily: "What do you want to run
away from me for?"</p>

<p>"Because I'm afraid of your Royal Majesty," stuttered
the poor devil.</p>

<p>"Afraid?" thundered Frederick William, giving the
fellow another whack with his cane. "Afraid?"&mdash;the beating
continuing&mdash;"when I, your King, commanded you to
love me. Love me, you miserable coward, love God's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
Anointed." And the loving Majesty broke his cane on
the unloving subject's back.</p>

<p>Two days before our arrival Prince George sent his
adjutant, Baron de Metsch-Reichenbeck, to the Mayor of
Dresden, stopping all reception arrangements contemplated.</p>

<p>To have children was a mere picnic to Her Imperial
Highness, lied George's messenger,&mdash;if the physicians
hadn't used chloroform I would have perished with the
torture. Ovations intended as a sort of reward or
recognition of my services to the country, then,
would be entirely out of place, and must not be
thought of.</p>

<p>The municipality thereupon officially abandoned preparations.
I was a little vexed when I first heard about
George's meanness, yet again felt tickled that he went out
of his way to intrigue against me, the despised little princess
of a House that ceased to reign. And I had an idea
that the Dresdeners would give us a good welcome anyhow.</p>

<p>I had contemplated ordering my special train to leave
in the early morning or at noon, but the Ministry of Railways
informed me that it was impossible to accommodate
me at the hours mentioned.</p>

<p>"We will take the ordinary express, then, and will be
in Dresden at four in the afternoon," I suggested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"According to the new schedule, the express doesn't
stop in Dresden," protested Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>"We will command it to stop," I cried.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus looked at me as if I had asked
him to borrow twenty marks from the Kaiser. "For God's
sake!" he cried, "don't you know what happened to John
the other day?"</p>

<p>I confessed my ignorance.</p>

<p>"Well," said Frederick Augustus, "John ordered the
Continental express to pick him up at his garrison, and he
had no sooner arrived in Dresden than he was commanded
by the King to appear before him. His Majesty walked
all over John, accusing him of 'interfering with international
traffic' and forbidding him to issue another order
of that character."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" I said, "John is merely a childless princeling.
I am the mother of Saxony's future king. The regeneration,
the perpetuation of your race depends on me."</p>

<p>It was a mere waste of breath, for at that moment
came a telegram, announcing that our special was billed
to leave at 3:30, getting us to Dresden at half-past five&mdash;King's
orders.</p>

<p>"Did you command the <i>Daumont</i> coach-and-four to
meet us at the station?" I asked.</p>

<p>"My dear child, you are dreaming," replied Frederick
Augustus. "The State carriages are the property of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Crown and we don't own a four-horse team in Dresden.
They will send the ordinary royal carriage, I suppose."</p>

<p>I was mad enough to wish my husband's family to
Hades, the whole lot of them, but the people of Dresden
took revenge in hand and dealt most liberally. Of course,
having fixed our arrival at a late and unusual hour, George
expected there would be no one to welcome us, but the
great concourse of people that actually assembled at the
station and in the adjacent streets, lining them up to the
palace gates, was tremendous instead.</p>

<p>One more disappointment. George had sent an inconspicuous,
narrow <i>coup&eacute;</i> to the station,&mdash;the Dresdeners
shouldn't see more than the point of my nose. I saw
through his scheme the moment I clapped eyes on that
mouse-trap of a vehicle standing at the curb.</p>

<p>And then I remembered the brilliant stagecraft of
August the Physical Strong&mdash;he of the three hundred and
fifty-two&mdash;and how he always managed to focus everybody's
eyes on himself. And I stood stockstill on the
broad, red-carpeted terrace when I walked out of the waiting
room and held up my baby in the face of the multitude.
You could hear the "<i>Hochs</i>" and Hurrahs all over town,
they said. Hats flew in the air, handkerchiefs waved, flags
were thrust out of the windows of the houses.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Imperial Highness?" whispered
<i>Fr&auml;ulein von</i> Schoenberg, my lady-in-waiting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, I will carry the baby to the carriage," I
answered curtly.</p>

<p>"But the King and Prince George will be angry,&mdash;everything
will be reported to them."</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope it will," I said.</p>

<p>And before I entered that petty <i>sourici&egrave;re</i> of a royal
coach, I danced the baby above my head time and again,
giving everybody a chance to see him. And as I stood
there in the midst of this tumult of applause, this waving
sea of good-will, this thunder of jubilation, I felt proud
and happy as I never did before. And when the thought
struck me how mad George would feel about it all, I had
to laugh outright.</p>

<p>I was still grinning to myself when I heard Frederick
Augustus's troubled voice: "Get in, what are you standing
around here for?"&mdash;These manifestations of popularity
spelt "all-highest" displeasure to him, poor noodle. He
anticipated the scene at the palace, George fuming and
charging "play to the gallery," the Queen in tears, the
King threatening to banish us from Dresden.</p>

<p>"Be it so," I said to myself, "we might as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb." And I refused to enter
the carriage until I had waved and smiled profound thanks
to everybody in the square and in the windows and on
the balconies of the surrounding houses.</p>

<p>I saw the Master of Horse address the coachman and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
immediately divined his purpose. So I pulled at the rope
and commanded the coachman to drive slowly. I said it
in my most imperious manner, and the Master of Horse
dared not give the counter order with which Prince George
had charged him. Poor man, his failure to subordinate my
will to his, or George's, cost him his job.</p>

<p>And so we made our royal entry into Dresden amid
popular rejoicings. I glued my face to the carriage window
and smiled and smiled and showed the baby to everyone
who asked for the boon.</p>

<p>Baby took it all in a most dignified fashion. He
neither squalled nor kicked, but seemed to enjoy the homage
paid him.</p>

<p>When we reached the palace there was another big
crowd of well-wishers, who shouted themselves hoarse for
Louise and the baby, and, malicious thing that I am, I
noticed with pleasure that it all happened under George's
windows.</p>

<p>"This will give father-in-law jaundice," said baby's
nurse in Italian. She is a girl from Tuscany and very
devoted to me.</p>

<p>"If he dies, I will be Queen the sooner," thought I,&mdash;but
happily I didn't think aloud.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>I wrote the foregoing at one sitting, without interruption.
It's not so easy a matter to put down the consequences
of our triumph, or rather mine and baby's.</p>

<p>When I entered my apartments, I met a whole host of
long faces. The Commander of the Palace, in great gala,
offered a most stiff and icy welcome. The adjutants, the
chamberlains, the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'H&ocirc;tel</i>, all looked ill at ease.
They evidently felt the coming storm in their bones and
didn't care to have it said of them, by George's spies, that
they lent countenance, even in a most remote way, to my
carryings-on. Even the Schoenberg&mdash;my own woman&mdash;shot
reproachful glances at me when the Commander of the
Palace happened to look her way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick Augustus looked and acted as if he was
to be deprived of all his military honors.</p>

<p>"Your courage must have fallen into your <i>cuirassier</i>
boots, look for it there," I said to him in an undertone when
he seemed ready to go to pieces at the entrance of the
King's grand marshal, Count Vitzthum.</p>

<p>With that I advanced towards His Excellency and,
holding out my hand to be kissed, took care to say to
him with my most winning smile,</p>

<p>"I trust His Majesty will be pleased with me, for of
course our grand reception was but a reflex of the love
the people have for their King. I never for a moment took
it as a personal compliment."</p>

<p>My smart little speech disconcerted the official completely.
Maybe he had orders to say something disagreeable,
but my remark disarmed him, forestalled any quarrel
that might have been in the King's or Prince George's
mind.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus, who is no more intelligent than
a future king should be, was so amazed, he had to think
hard and long before he could even say "Good evening" to
the Count. As for the latter, he hawed and coughed and
stammered and cleared his throat until finally he succeeded
in delivering himself of the following sublime effort:</p>

<p>"I will have the honor to report to His Majesty that
during the time of your Imperial Highness's entry, your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Imperial Highness thought of naught but the all-highest
approval of His Majesty."</p>

<p>Whereupon I shook his hand again and dismissed
him. "It will please me immensely, Count," I said, "immensely."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course her pleasure is a command. I dressed in
state and ordered all the ladies and gentlemen of my court
to attend me to the royal chambers.</p>

<p>Queen Carola was very nice, giving the impression
that she would be more lovely still if she dared.</p>

<p>"Prince George has just commanded your husband,"
she said,&mdash;"the King ordered this condescension on my
brother-in-law's part. You will have to thank him for it."</p>

<p>Isn't it amusing to be an Imperial Highness and a
Crown Princess to be ordered around like a "boots" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to be "commanded" like an orphan child to say thanks to
one's betters!</p>

<p>I promised and the Queen, assuming that I intended
to act the good little girl, took courage to say&mdash;for she
is the biggest of cowards&mdash;"You are too popular, Louise.
Such a reception as you had! All the papers, even the
Jew-sheets, are full of it."</p>

<p>And before I could make any excuses for my popularity
she added in sorrowful, half-accusing tones: "I
lived here ever so many years and the mob never applauded
<i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"It's so fickle," I quoted. I had to say something, you
know.</p>

<p>"And contemptible," added the Queen heartily. "But
how is baby?"</p>

<p>I begged permission to send for him. Her Majesty
was pleased to play with the little one for a minute or
two and that secured me a gracious exit. The Queen
attended me to the door, opening it with her own royal
hand, thereby rehabilitating me with my entourage waiting
outside.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Frederick Augustus had a "critical quarter
of an hour" with father-in-law, who assumed to speak on
behalf of the King.</p>

<p>"The King," he said, "despised 'playing to the gallery'
worse than the devil hated holy water." (This court is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
overrun with Jesuits, and we must needs adopt their vernacular.)</p>

<p>The King, he repeated, thought it very bad taste for
anyone to take the centre of the stage in these "popularity-comedies,"
and he told a lot more lies of the same character.
Then he bethought himself of his own grieved
authority.</p>

<p>"Tell your wife," he said, "that I, her father-in-law,
and next to the throne, do everything in my power to
escape such turbulent scenes, and that I would rather ride
about town in an ordinary <i>Droschke</i> (cab) of the second
class, preserving my incognito, than in a state carriage
and be the object of popular acclamation."</p>

<p>When Frederick Augustus repeated the above with
the most solemn face in the world, I thought I would die
with laughter and actually had to send for my tire-woman
to let my corset out a few notches.</p>

<p>"The old monkey," I cried&mdash;"as if he wasn't after
'<i>Hochs</i>' morning, noon and night; as if he thought of
anything else when he mounts a carriage or his horse."</p>

<p>"You forget yourself, Louise," warned Frederick
Augustus in the voice of an undertaker, and I really
think he meant it. But I wasn't in the mood to be
silenced.</p>

<p>"And as if I didn't know that, like Kaiser Wilhelm,
he keeps a record of towns and villages that were never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
honored by one of his visits, intending to make his ceremonial
entry there at the first plausible opportunity."</p>

<p>"It isn't true," insisted Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>Then I got angry. "It may be thought polite in the
bosom of your family to call one another a liar," I retorted,
"but don't you get into the habit of introducing those tap-room
manners in the <i>m&eacute;nage</i> of an Imperial Highness of
Austria. I forbid it."</p>

<p>And then I gave rein to some of the bitterness that
had accumulated in my heart against the old man. Didn't
I know that George was mad enough to quarrel with his
dinner when, on his drives about town, he observed a single
person refusing to salute him? And wasn't it a fact
that the Socialists had combined never more to raise their
hats to him just because he insisted on it? And wasn't
that one of the reasons why the government was more
hard on them than happened to be politic?</p>

<p>"You mustn't say these things," pleaded Frederick
Augustus.</p>

<p>I pretended to melt. "May I not quote your father's
own words?"</p>

<p>"What my father says is always correct," replied the
dutiful son.</p>

<p>"Well, then, this is what he told House Minister von
Seydowitz a couple of weeks ago: 'When I see one of these
intending destroyers of the state and social order staring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
at me, hat on head and cigar in face, I doubly regret the
good old times when kings and princes were at liberty
to yank a scoundrel of that ilk to jail and immure him
for life, giving him twenty-five stripes daily to teach him
the desirableness of rendering unto C&aelig;sar that which is
C&aelig;sar's.'"</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus was holding his hands to his ears
when I finished. He ran out and slammed the door behind
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<h4>UNSPEAKABLE LITTLENESSES OF PETTY COURTS</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Another quarrel with my husband&mdash;Personal attendant to a
corpse&mdash;Killing by pin pricks&mdash;The mythical three "<i>How
art thou's?</i>"&mdash;Unwanted sympathy from my inferiors&mdash;Pride
of the decapitated Queen of France is in me&mdash;Lovers not
impossible&mdash;Court to blame for them&mdash;My husband acts
cowardly&mdash;Brutalizes my household&mdash;I lock myself in.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>December 1, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I saved myself the trouble to record events for two or
three months. I expect my child by the end of the year
and, believing in prenatal influence, it would be a shame,
I think, to poison the unborn baby's mind by dwelling on
the unspeakable littlenesses that make up and burden life
at this petty court.</p>

<p>But I may die in the attempt of presenting Saxony
with another candidate for appanages and honors, and
this threat, hanging over every expectant mother, makes
me take up my pen again. If I perish, let there be a record
of my sufferings and also of my defiance.</p>

<p>It turned out that the Queen's and George's apparent
acquiescence to my sinful popularity marked the deceitful
calm before the storm. Frederick Augustus has not suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>ceeded
in gaining the King's and his father's forgiveness
even now. As a military officer he is shunted from pillar
to post, and the generals and high officials of the court
treat him like a recruit in disgrace. Of course he blames
me, shouting that I wrecked his career.</p>

<p>As if a future king need care a rap whether, as
prince, he got a regiment a few months earlier or later.</p>

<p>"When you are King," I sometimes say to him, "you
may nominate yourself Field-Marshal-General and Great-Admiral
above and below the sea&mdash;what do you care?"</p>

<p>"It isn't the same," he moans. "I would like to have
my patents signed by uncle or father."</p>

<p>"Antedate your papers," I advised, "who dare dispute
the king? Didn't the Kaiser nominate himself Adjutant-General
to his grand-dad long after William I lay mouldering
in Charlottenburg?"</p>

<p>But Frederick Augustus takes colonel-ships and his
petty kingship of the future too seriously to see even the
humor of appointing oneself personal attendant to a corpse.</p>

<p>As for me, if I weren't <i>enceinte</i>, they would send me to
some lost-in-the-woods country house to die of <i>ennui</i>. But
respect for public opinion forbidding drastic measures,
George relies on a Russian expedient to humble my proud
self and force me to submit to his meddling.</p>

<p>In the Czar's country, when a village resolves on the
death of some obnoxious individual, they take him, or her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and bind the body naked to a tree. Then several papers
of pins are distributed among the inhabitants, and each
man, woman and child is asked to put a pin in the lady or
gentleman, whom they must approach blindfolded. They
stick the pin wherever they touch the body and if the thing
leaks out are able to swear by all the saints that they don't
know where it struck. The pin pricking is continued until
the obnoxious one expires amid awful tortures and, while
all contributed to the murder, none can be hanged for it.</p>

<p>In like manner George and his minions are trying
to reduce me to the position of social and political corpse.</p>

<p>Court festivities and public acts, attended by the court,
seem to be specially arranged to pillorize me and husband.
We are invited, of course. We are next in importance to
Prince George. Our entourage is more numerous and more
richly costumed than that of the other princes. Four
horse coaches for us; Ministers of State waiting on us.
I have train-bearers, pages, what-not.</p>

<p>But the King and Prince George cut me and Frederick
Augustus in sight of the whole court, of the public
in fact!</p>

<p>I don't mean to say that the "All-highest Lords," as
they call themselves, treat us as air, or offer insult plain
to the ear and eye&mdash;they couldn't afford to&mdash;nevertheless
the stigma of royal disfavor is stamped on us. This is the
mode of proceedings: Ceremony obliges the King to ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>dress
each member of the royal family with the words:
"How do you do?", in the German fashion, "<i>How art thou?</i>"</p>

<p>To princes and princesses that are in disgrace, this
momentous question is put only once. Those in good
standing are asked three times.</p>

<p>Ever since that September day when all Dresden did
me honor, the King and Prince George have said "<i>How
art thou's?</i>" to me and mine but once, whenever and wherever
we met, and be sure there were always listeners to
report the double omission.</p>

<p>At first it amused me; then enraged me; I don't care
a fig now. But Frederick Augustus! Poor imbecile, he
is eating his heart out about those two missing "<i>How art
thou's?</i>" and though he looks splendid in gala uniform
he acts in the royal, but ungracious, presence like a green
recruit expecting to be kicked and cuffed by his noncommissioned
officer on getting back to the barracks.</p>

<p>As to my entourage, it surrenders to royal disfavor
even as Frederick Augustus: depressed faces, pitying
glances. I could box their ears for their sympathy.</p>

<p>Am I not the great-granddaughter of that mighty Maria
Theresa that ruled Austria and Hungary with an iron
hand, lined with velvet. "<i>Moriamur pro rege nostro</i>" (We
will die for our King), cried the Hungarians, when she
appealed to their chivalry, her new-born babe at her breast.
"<i>Rege</i>," not "<i>Regina</i>." They called her King. They for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>got
the woman in the monarch, yet I am treated like an
insipid female always, never as the Crown Princess!</p>

<p>Let them beware. My full name is Louise Marie Antoinette.
I was named after the Marie Antoinette of history&mdash;another
ancestor of mine&mdash;and the pride of the decapitated
Queen of France is in me! My namesake was
satisfied when she read the Saint-Antoine placard of June
25, 1791: "Whosoever insults Marie Antoinette shall be
caned, whosoever applauds her shall be hanged." Some
day I will dismiss the cattle that now grudge me the people's
applause and punish those that insult me.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Marie Antoinette had not only
pride and defiance, she had lovers too. Well, some day
this Marie Antoinette may have lovers, and if it's wrong,
let the recording angel debit my sins to the Saxon
court.</p>

<p>Thank God, I am blessed with that truly royal attribute,
ability to dissimulate. "<i>Qui nescit dissimulare nescit
regnare</i>" was all the Latin Charles VIII knew, yet he made
a pretty successful king for one who died at the age of
twenty-seven.</p>

<p>I always act as if the King, and father-in-law George,
had asked me not once, or three times, but a dozen times
"<i>How art thou?</i>" I don't know anything about being in
disgrace, I don't anticipate being snubbed and when I am
snubbed I don't see it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The "all-highest Lord" looks daggers at me&mdash;I curtsy
and smile!</p>

<p>Father-in-law Prince George exhibits the visage of a
poisoned pole-cat at my table&mdash;I congratulate him on his
good digestion!</p>

<p>Majesty pays no more attention to my presence than
if I was a pillar, or a lackey; I greet him with my most
devoted genuflections, rise from the carpet smiling all over
the face and begin a frivolous conversation with the nearest
man at hand, who in his fright acts as if he had taken
an overdose of physic.</p>

<p>If Frederick Augustus only had an inch of backbone,
a pinch of ginger in his constitution! But he always stands
around with a red face and the mien of a penitent. No
dog, accustomed to daily beatings, follows his master's
movements with more anxious looks than the Crown Prince
of this realm bestows upon the goings and sayings of the
King and Prince George.</p>

<p>Then, as recompense for his royal feast of toads, he
plays the tyrant at home. Jellyfish in the state apartments,
a brute in our own and&mdash;on the drill grounds, I am told!
He is always finding fault with the servants, and cares
not whether he calls his Court Marshal, or a groom, "<i>Lausbub</i>."
Poor Chamberlain von Tumpling earned that scurvy
epithet the other day and he prides himself on being a
nobleman and an army officer! Only this morning the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
prince roared and bellowed at one of my ladies, I thought
she would have a stroke from righteous anger and vexation.</p>

<p>When he attempted to address me in the same fashion,
I simply turned my back on him, went into my boudoir
and locked the door. I will keep him "guessing" for two
days, sending for the court physician every little while.</p>

<p>When he has to eat his meals alone and sleep alone for
twice twenty-four hours, it will occur even to him that
Louise is not made of the stuff that stands for being bullied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<h4>IMPERIAL RUSSIAN ETHICS TRANSFERRED TO DRESDEN</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My husband's reported escapade&mdash;Did he give diamonds to a
dancing girl?&mdash;His foolish excuses&mdash;"I am your pal"&mdash;A
restaurant scene in St. Petersburg&mdash;The birthday suit.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>December 3, 1893</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>After all, Frederick Augustus has more spirit than I
gave him credit for. Isabelle just told me that he has a
new love, and a very appetizing piece of femininity she is,
<i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> Dolores of the Municipal Theatre.</p>

<p>"She's as well made as you, Louise, and rather more
graceful," she said, "only her expression is somewhat inert.
She lacks animation. Of course, she hasn't your attractive
bust."</p>

<p>That devilish Isabelle <i>sowed</i> her poisonous information
rather than pronounced it. "She has been seen with a new
diamond-studded <i>bandeau</i>," she added.</p>

<p>At that moment the Schoenberg came to say that baby
wants me. Isabelle went along to the nursery, but I managed
to take the Schoenberg aside.</p>

<p>"I must know, before dinner, who gave the Dolores
woman the new jewelry she is displaying; likewise whether<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
His Royal Highness is sweet on that hussy. No half-truths,
if you please. I want to know the worst if there
be any."</p>

<p>The Schoenberg has a cousin who is a Councillor in
the office of the police president, and the police president
keeps a detailed record of the love affairs of all the
actresses and singers employed in Dresden,&mdash;a relic of the
time when stage folks, in European capitals, classed as
"the King's servants."</p>

<p>The Councillor came himself to report and, after listening
to what he said, I raised the boycott on Frederick
Augustus without further ado, inviting him to my bed and
board once more.</p>

<p>"So you went slumming with Kyril," I said after we
had retired for the night.</p>

<p>"Who told you?" stammered the big fellow, reddening
to the roots of his hair.</p>

<p>"Never mind. I know all! About the Dolores woman,
her brand new diamonds, the pirouettes she did on the
table and the many lace petticoats she wore."</p>

<p>"My word, I didn't count them," vowed his Royal
Highness.</p>

<p>"Neither would I advise you to do so," I warned sternly,
though as a matter of fact I was near exploding with
laughter. "Now make a clean breast of it."</p>

<p>"I swear I was only the elephant. The King himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
would excuse me under the circumstances," whimpered my
husband.</p>

<p>"You big booby," I interposed, "can't you see that I'm
not angry? I blab about you to the King? What do you
take me for? I am your pal, now and always, in affairs
liable to prove inartistic to the King's, or Prince George's,
stomach. To begin with, what has an elephant to do with
supping with a dancing girl?"</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus explained that the name of the
pachyderm applies to a third party, who attends a couple
out for a lark until he proves a crowd. Our cousin, Grand-duke
Kyril of Russia, visiting Dresden incognito, had prevailed
on Frederick Augustus's good nature to serve him
and the Dolores.</p>

<p>"The Dolores is prettier than I?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Not at all. She has a black mole under her left
bosom."</p>

<p>"You saw that?"</p>

<p>"How could I help it? Russian Grand-dukes never
allow a girl to wear corsets at supper. Kyril says it interferes
with digestion."</p>

<p>How considerate of His Russian Imperial Highness!</p>

<p>Well, they had a good time and I guess the Dolores
earned her diamonds. A fair exchange is no robbery.
"But in St. Petersburg," said Frederick Augustus, "they do
these things better." And he gave an elaborate description<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of a famous restaurant there, where the princes of the
imperial family hold high carnival occasionally.</p>

<p>"The upper tier of dining rooms is reserved at night
for any Grand-duke who promises his visit," quoted my
husband, "and the broad marble stairs leading to them
must not be used by others. Well, one fine evening Grand-duke
Vladimir and a crowd of nobles and officers supped
at the '<i>Ermitaj</i>' and when they were all good and drunk,
one of Vladimir's guests, Prince Galitzin, bet the host the
price of the supper and a champagne bath for all, that he
could induce the famous <i>danseuse</i> Mshinskaya to descend
the stairs stark naked and walk among the tables below
without anyone offering her insult.</p>

<p>"The bet was accepted and the girl sent for. She was
found in a near-by theatre and rushed to the '<i>Ermitaj</i>'.
Of course, seeing that His Imperial Highness wished it,
she consented to pull off the trick and&mdash;her clothes, but she
made a condition."</p>

<p>"She demanded tights," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, she is a sport, says Kyril." This in a tone of
disgust from Frederick Augustus. He continued: "She
merely begged his Imperial Highness to have it announced
that she, Mshinskaya, was acting under the Grand-duke's
orders. Done. 'By His Imperial Highness's leave,' shouted
the <i>Ma&icirc;tre d'H&ocirc;tel</i> from the top of the stairs, as
<i>Mademoiselle</i> descended in her birthday suit. And the Mshinskaya<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
made the tour of the restaurant as unconcernedly and as
little subject to protests, or remarks, as if she had been
muffled up to her ears.</p>

<p>"That's what I call freedom&mdash;discipline," concluded
Frederick Augustus. "Think of doing anything like that
in a Dresden restaurant."</p>

<p>"I would gladly give a year's allowance to the poor
if you could manage it here while Prince George was masticating
a Hamburg steak at a table opposite the grand
staircase," said I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<h4>ROYALTY NOT PRETTY, AND WHY</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Fecundity royal women's greatest charm&mdash;How to have beautiful
children.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>February 25, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Behold the mother of two boys in a twelve-month!
Frederick came just in the nick of time, Sylvester Eve
(December 31, 1893), to gain me a little brief renown, for
royalty likes its women to be rabbits and, in the reigning
houses at least, we are esteemed in proportion to our fecundity.</p>

<p>"January 15&mdash;December 31," not half bad! Even Prince
George had to admit that. And the Kaiser remarked:
"Louise, if she keeps it up, bids fair to break de Villeneuve's
record. Let me see, Sophie's first child was born January
9&mdash;a girl" (with a sneer); "her next, the Hereditary Count,
on December 28th of the same year."</p>

<p>The "de Villeneuve" is Sophie, Countess of Schlitz.
Wilhelm made her celebrated by his gallantries and Lenbach
by the great portrait he painted of her wondrous
loveliness. If I ever have a daughter, I will have a copy
of the Lenbach canvas placed in baby's room. Come to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
think of it, I will have one made right away to hang in my
own boudoir.</p>

<p>As stated, I believe in prenatal influence, and am more
than convinced that the portraits of Saxon and Prussian
princesses frowning from the walls of our palaces are calculated
neither to promote beauty nor gentleness.</p>

<p>If I had my way, I would send the whole lot to the
store-room and fill the space they occupy with the present
store-room treasures, old time portraits of August the
Physical Strong's favorites, Aurora von K&ouml;nigsmark, Countess
Cosel, Princess Lubomirska, Fatime, the Circassian,
the Orselska and&mdash;who can remember their names?</p>

<p>As a rule, queens and princesses are conspicuous for
lack of beauty, while kings and princes cut most ordinary
figures in <i>mufti</i>. Only their uniforms, the ribands and decorations,
the <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> render them tolerable imitations
of the average military man.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because their mothers and fathers, their sisters, cousins
and aunts see nothing but painted and photographed and
sculptured frights and grotesques. So much ugliness of
the past must needs cause ugliness of the present and
future.</p>

<p>In a century the thrones of Europe have known but
two beauties, both plebeians, the Empress Josephine and
the Empress Eugenie. My aunt, the Empress Elizabeth, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
only good-looking, the German Empress was just an ordinary
German <i>Frau</i> even in her salad-days.</p>

<p>Well, my little girls, if I have any, shall profit by the
lessons of the past. As expectant mothers in ancient Greece
were wont to walk in the temple of <i>Athene Parthenos</i>, filled
with the greatest sculptures the world has ever seen (ruins
of them I admired in the British Museum), so I intend
to have a gallery of my own for beauty's sake, even if
every female figure be a harlot's likeness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<h4>MORE JEALOUSIES OF THE GREAT</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Men and women caress me with their eyes&mdash;Some disrespectful

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>April 1, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I am afraid I wrote down some wicked things&mdash;wicked
from the standpoint of the Saxon court&mdash;and though Queen
Carola and father-in-law George know naught of my scribblings,
punishment was meted out to me in full measure.</p>

<p>Of course, it's my "damned popularity," as the King
calls it, that got me into trouble again. My carriage happened
to follow one occupied by the Queen at a distance
of some hundred or more paces along the avenues of the
<i>Grosser Garten</i>. I had no idea that Her Majesty was out
at the time, and certainly was dressed to please the eye.
I can't help it. It's a habit with me.</p>

<p>Well, the optics of a good many of my future subjects
grew long and cozening, like gipsies', when they beheld
their queen-to-be; there was many a "flatteringly protracted,
but never a wiltingly disapproving gaze," and those
who liked me&mdash;and they all seemed to&mdash;shouted "Our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Louise," and Hurrah. They shouted so loud that poor
Queen Carola got plenty of auricular evidence of how her
successor-to-be was loved by the people, by <i>her</i>, Carola's,
people. And the poor old girl got so "peeved," she
ordered her coachman to turn back and proceed to
the palace by the shortest route, through the least frequented
streets.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus knew all about it before I reached
home and was in a terribly dejected state.</p>

<p>"This has to stop," he said with a fine effort at imitating
authority. "On Sunday, when we drove home from
High Mass, you got an ovation while the King's carriage
passed almost unnoticed. And now this affront to the
Queen."</p>

<p>"Bother the old girl," I replied, stamping my foot.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus got as white as a sheet. "That's
the language of a&mdash;a&mdash;" He knew enough not to finish.</p>

<p>"It's the title by which Queen Victoria is known to
many of her subjects."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"I often run across it in the English newspapers."</p>

<p>"Jew-sheets!" roared Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>"Since you don't understand a word of English, you
couldn't distinguish the London Times from the Hebrew
At Work." After this sally, I added maliciously: "I'm
going to the Op&eacute;ra Comique tonight. Come along?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are <i>not</i> going to the Op&eacute;ra Comique," shouted
Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>"You don't want me to go, papa don't want me to
go, uncle and aunt and cousins don't? So many reasons
more why I <i>shall</i> go. I announced my coming and I will
go, if I have to tear the ropes, by which you might bind
me hand and foot, with my teeth."</p>

<p>I rang the bell and ordered dinner served half an
hour earlier than usual. Then I went to my dressing room
to inspect the new gown that I intended to wear at the
theatre.</p>

<p>Girardi night! Girardi, the famous Vienna comedian!
I never saw him. His humor will act as a tonic. Just what
I need. I will die if I breathe none other but the air of
this palace, that reeks with cheap pretensions, Jesuitical
puritanism, envy and hatred, where every second person is a
spy of either the King or George.</p>

<p>I must escape the polluted atmosphere for a few hours,
at least, and laugh, laugh, LAUGH.</p>

<h4>THE ROYAL PRINCE, WHO BEHAVES LIKE A DRUNKEN BRICKLAYER</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I face the music, but my husband runs away&mdash;Prince George

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>April 2, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Chamberlain Baron Haugk, of the service of Prince
George, called at nine A.M. and insisted upon seeing me.
I sent out my Grand-Mistress, Baroness von Tisch, to tell
him that "Her Imperial Highness would graciously permit
him to wait upon her at half past ten."</p>

<p>"But my all-highest master commands."</p>

<p>I was listening in my boudoir and I went out to him
only half-dressed, a powder-mantle over my shoulders.</p>

<p>"Her Imperial Highness will not have her commands
questioned by servants," I said in my most haughty style.
The <i>Kammerherr</i> knocked his heels together, bowed to the
ground and retired. That's my way of dealing with royal
flunkeys, no matter what their title of courtesy.</p>

<p>He was back at the stroke of the clock to announce his
"sublime master" for one in the afternoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will be ready to receive his Royal Highness. My
household shall be instructed," I answered coldly, though
I dread that old man.</p>

<p>"You are not wanted," I told Frederick Augustus.
"Better make yourself scarce." He didn't need to be told
twice. "Undress-uniform," he shouted to his valet. "And
send somebody for a cab."</p>

<p>"Why a cab?" I inquired.</p>

<p>He looked at me in a pitying way. "Women are such
geese," he made answer. "Don't you see, if I left the
palace in one of our own carriages, the King, or father,
might notice and call me back."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. And don't 'celebrate' too much while
you are out."</p>

<p>I had the lackeys line the staircase and corridors. My
military household stood in the first ante-chamber, my
courtiers in the second, my ladies in the third when Prince
George walked into my parlor. At first he acted in no
unfriendly manner. He kissed me on the forehead and
asked after the babies, and if he hadn't riveted his eyes all
the time into some corner of the room&mdash;his stratagem when
in an ugly mood&mdash;I might have persuaded myself that he
wasn't on mischief bent.</p>

<p>But he soon began pouring out his bile. With a face
like a wooden martyr he announced that he was not pleased
with me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are too much of a light-weight, too vivacious, too
attractive to the mob," he said in his bitterest tones. "You
are forever seeking the public eye like&mdash;an actress."</p>

<p>"I beg your Royal Highness to take notice that Imperial
Princesses of Austria"&mdash;I put some emphasis on the
Imperial&mdash;"while popular, never descend to jugglery," I
answered politely, but firmly.</p>

<p>"No offence to your Imperial Highness," said George,
"but you must understand once and for all that Saxon
princes and princesses are bound by our house laws to
the strictest observance of precedence. The love of the
people naturally goes out to the King and Queen. Junior
members of the Royal House must not seek to divert to
themselves the popularity that is the King's own."</p>

<p>"I have always been taught to respond to popular
greetings offered me. My aunt, the Empress Elizabeth, in
particular instructed me to that effect," I submitted with
great deference.</p>

<p>"Her Majesty didn't instruct you to make a show of
yourself every hour of the day," hissed George, his eyes
devouring the stove.</p>

<p>"I drive out twice, in the morning to go shopping,
in the afternoon to air my babies."</p>

<p>George, unable to dispute me, abandoned pretensions
of politeness or manners. He fairly roared at me: "You
are travelling the streets all the time. It has to stop."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>Whereupon I said in as sharp a voice as I could manage:
"And Your Royal Highness has to stop bellowing at
me. I'm not used to it. In Salzburg and Vienna gentlemen
don't use that tone of voice and that sort of language
to gentlewomen."</p>

<p>"Salzburg," cried George, "in Salzburg you got your
ears boxed, but it didn't do much good to all appearances."</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness," I answered, "my mother has
her faults, but it's no one's business outside of her immediate
family. And no one at this court has a mother's
authority over me."</p>

<p>I saw that George was beside himself with rage.
"If your husband," he snarled, "was as free with his
hand as your mother, there would be an end to your frivolities."</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness forgets what you admitted yourself,
namely, that the indignities offered me while I was a
child were bereft of beneficial results. And please take
notice," I added, raising my voice, "I won't stand violence
from anyone, neither from my husband&mdash;as you kindly suggest&mdash;nor
from you, or the King."</p>

<p>George was too surprised to even attempt a reply. He
evidently didn't know what to say or do. To avoid my
eyes that were seeking his, he turned his back on me and
stepped up to a little table laden with books. He studied
the titles for a while, then, turning suddenly, held a small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
volume towards me. His arm was out-stretched as if he
feared to contaminate his uniform.</p>

<p>"What have we got here?" he cried.</p>

<p>It was my turn to be astonished. "Why, according to
the binding, it must be Heine's <i>Atta Troll</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Atta Troll</i>," cried George, and opening the book at
random he read half to himself:</p>

<p>
"This bear-leader six Madonnas<br />
Wears upon his pointed hat,<br />
To protect his head from bullets<br />
Or from lice, perchance, it may be."<br />
</p>

<p>He fired the volume on the floor and grabbed another.
"What's this?"</p>

<p>"As the title will indicate to your Royal Highness,
Nietzsche's Zarathustra." For the life of me I couldn't
see any harm in this portion of my library.</p>

<p>George continued to rummage among the books. He
acted like a madman. "What's this, what's this?" he kept
on saying, turning them over and over. I thought it beneath
my dignity to answer. I just stared at the fanatic.</p>

<p>After he finished his hurried examination, he took one
book after the other and tossed it violently at my feet.</p>

<p>"Heine, the Jew-scribbler," he cried, aiming a kick
at Atta Troll.</p>

<p>"Don't you dare," I said, "that book was given me by
Her Majesty, the Empress of Austria."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't believe it," shouted George, "that Jew-scribbler,
the reviler of kinship."</p>

<p>"He never lampooned the kings of Saxony," I calmly
remarked, picking up the volume. "Here is Her Majesty's
dedication to me."</p>

<p>"Everybody knows the eccentricities of Her Majesty
of Austria," shouted George. "Anyhow, who gave you permission
to read such rotten stuff as this at our court?"</p>

<p>"Prince George," I answered, taking two steps towards
him, "Duke of Saxony, the Archduchess of Austria takes
pleasure to inform you that in her house she asks no one's
permission what to read or do."</p>

<p>At this he turned drill-ground bully. "You are in the
King's house," rang out his voice in cutting tones, "and at
this moment I represent the King. And in the King's name
I forbid you to read these obscenities, and in the King's
name I hereby command that these books be destroyed at
once."</p>

<p>Well, since he talked in the King's name I had no
leg to stand on. I merely bowed acquiescence and he
strutted out, turning his back on me as he went without
salutation of any sort. I ran into my room, locked the
door and had a good cry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h4>I DEFY THEM</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Laughter and pleasant faces for me&mdash;Frederick Augustus refuses
to back me, but I don't care&mdash;We quarrel about my reading&mdash;He
professes to gross ignorance.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>May 1, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>What's the use keeping a diary that is nothing but a
record of quarrels and humiliations? After I finished the
entry about my scene with Prince George, I felt considerably
relieved. I had held my own, anyhow. But fighting
is one thing and writing another. I am always ready for
a fight, but "war-reporting" comes less easy.</p>

<p>The unpleasantness with George brought in its wake,
as a natural consequence so to speak, a whole lot of other
squabbles and altercations, family jars and general rumpuses,
which I cared not to embalm in these pages at the
time. However, as they are part and parcel of my narrative,
incomplete as it may be, I will insert them by and by
according to their sequence.</p>

<p>After George was gone I made up my mind that, his
commands and threats notwithstanding, I must continue to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
live as I always did: joyful, free within certain limits and
careless of puritan standards. If the rest of the royal ladies,
and the women of the service, want to mope and look sour,
that's their affair. Let them wear out their lives between
confessional, knitting socks for orphan children, <i>Kaffe-klatsches,</i>
spying and tale-bearing and prayer-meetings,&mdash;it
isn't my style. I'm young, I'm pretty, I'm full of red blood,
life means something to me. I want to live it my own way.</p>

<p>I want to laugh; I have opinions of my own; I want
to read books that open and improve the mind. I want
to promote my education by attending lectures, by going
to the theatre&mdash;in short, I don't want to become a dunce
and a bell-jingling fool like the others.</p>

<p>If that spells royal disgrace&mdash;be it so. Louise won't
purchase two "<i>How art thou's?</i>" at the price their Majesties
and Royal Highnesses ask.</p>

<p>Of course, it would come easier with Frederick Augustus's
help and support, but since he chooses to be bully-ragged
and sat upon and, moreover, finds pleasure in licking
the hand that strikes at his and his wife's dignity, I
will go it alone.</p>

<p>I defy them.</p>

</p>

<p>I had another tiff with Frederick Augustus, but the
cause is too insignificant to deserve record. I will rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
tell about our grand quarrel following Prince George's visit.
We dined alone that day, as he was eager to hear the
news. The preliminaries didn't excite him much, but when
I mentioned the book episode, he bristled up.</p>

<p>"You won't allow the King, or Prince George, to dictate
what I shall read or not read?" I demanded. "My
house is my castle and I won't brook interference in my
<i>m&eacute;nage</i>."</p>

<p>"Do you really suppose," replied Frederick Augustus,
"that I'll court royal displeasure for the sake of those Jew-scribblers?
I never read a book since I left school and can't
make out what interest books can have to you or anyone
else. Where did you get them, anyhow?"</p>

<p>I told him that Leopold supplied my book wants. "My
brother is a very intelligent man," I said, "and the books
he gives me are all classics in their way."</p>

<p>"Go to with your book-talk!" he mocked in his most
contemptuous voice. "I asked the director of the royal
library and was told that each of the books, to which father
objects, was written by a Jew. Let Jews read them. It
isn't decent for a royal princess to do so."</p>

<p>"My brother isn't a Jew."</p>

<p>"But in utter disgrace in Vienna. No one at court
speaks to him. He is head over heels in debt and the next
we know he will be borrowing from us. As to those books,
don't bring any more into the house. Royal princes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
princesses have better things to do than waste time on Jew-scribblers."</p>

<p>With that he violently pushed back his chair and left
me, a very much enraged woman. He didn't give me the
chance to have the last word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>June 17, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The chance came later and with it the conviction that
His Royal Highness, Prince George, didn't quite believe
me when I told him that I wouldn't stand for violence, for
tonight Frederick Augustus attempted something of the
sort.</p>

<p>I had ordered my carriage for seven o'clock to drive
to the theatre, and had just finished dressing when he
stormed into my boudoir and demanded to know if I had
taken leave of my senses.</p>

<p>"Not that I am aware of."</p>

<p>"But I hear you intend to go to the theatre&mdash;a princess
in disgrace going to the theatre!"</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming along, Frederick Augustus?" I
asked na&iuml;vely.</p>

<p>"I have no desire to lose my regiment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I have no desire to sit at home and talk nothingnesses
with the fools His Majesty appoints for my
service."</p>

<p>"Take a care," cried Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>"Don't be a noodle and a coward," I answered hotly.</p>

<p>"Louise, remember that I am an army officer."</p>

<p>"What has that to do with my going to the theatre?"</p>

<p>"It's the height of audacity to defy the King."</p>

<p>"It would be the depth of cowardice to stay at home."</p>

<p>"Take back that word, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish Your Royal Highness a very pleasant evening,"
I said, indulging in a low genuflexion.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus got blue with rage. I saw him
clench his fists as I swept out of the room, making as much
noise with my train as I could manage.</p>

<p>"An out-rider," I commanded the Master of Horse who
stood in the ante-chamber awaiting me.</p>

<p>"At your Imperial Highness' commands," bowed the
Baron with the most astonished face in the world. We use
out-riders, that is grooms in livery, to ride ahead of the
royal carriage, only on state occasions in Dresden. But,
of course, my orders would be obeyed even if I had demanded
twelve grooms to attend me.</p>

<p>I was just going out, preceded by my Chamberlain and
followed by my ladies, Baroness Tisch and <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> von
Schoenberg; there were two lackeys at the door and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the corridor stood the groom-in-waiting, holding several
lap-robes for me to decide which to take, when the Prince
caught up with me.</p>

<p>"I forbid you to go to the theatre," he bawled in the
presence of my titled entourage and three servants.</p>

<p>I realized at once that this was the supreme moment
of my life at the court of Saxony. Either bend or break.
If I allowed myself to be roared at and ordered about like
a servant-wench&mdash;goodbye the Imperial Highness! Enter
the Jenny-Sneak German housewife, greedy for her master's
smile and willing to accept an occasional kick. The
Prince had begun this family brawl in public. I would
finish.</p>

<p>"I won't take orders," I held forth. "No commands,
understand, princely, royal or otherwise. And be advised,
now and for all time, that I will answer any attempt to
brutalize me by immediate departure, or by seeking refuge
with the Austrian Ambassador."</p>

<p>If Frederick Augustus had suddenly become Mrs. Lot
he wouldn't have been more conspicuous for utter petrification
and silence. He stared at me with wide-open, bleary
eyes and if I had taken him by the neck and feet and
dropped him out of the window, as his ancestor Augustus
of the three-hundred and fifty-two took the "spook" sent
into his bedroom by Joseph the First, he wouldn't have
offered the ghost of resistance, I dare say.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your arm, Mr. Chamberlain, since His Royal Highness
doesn't wish to accompany us." And I swept out of
the ante-chamber and through the corridor, triumphant.</p>

<p>"Gipsy Baron" was the bill of the play. I knew only
a few of its waltzes and I drank in the comedy and the
pretty music like one desperately athirst. Kyril's girl, the
Dolores, was very chic and looked ravishingly pretty, and
brother-in-law Max isn't the dunce I took him for.</p>

<p>His Theresa is a droll dog, fair to look upon, dark
and fat. It will take a lot of holy water to save her from
purgatory.</p>

<p>Girardi made me screech with laughter. He is as funny
as my father-in-law is mournful&mdash;a higher compliment to
his art I cannot pay. Of course, actor-like, he appreciated
an Imperial Highness' applause and looked up to my box
every little while. I wish, though, he hadn't acknowledged
my plaudits by bowing to me. It attracted general attention
and soon the whole house was staring and smiling.
The people seemed to be glad that their Crown Princess
was enjoying herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<h4>TITLED SERVANTS LOW AND CUNNING</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>George tries to rob me of my confidante&mdash;Enter the King's spy,
Baroness Tisch in her true character&mdash;Punishment of one
royal spy.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>August 1, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Prince George is planning a devilish revenge. He
threatens to separate me from my Secretary and confidante,
little Baranello, whom I brought with me from Salzburg.
She is an Italian, and, unlike most of them, as faithful as
a dog. A connection of the Ruffo family, princes and dukes
that gave the world more than one pope, the small fry
Saxon nobility hate her, and George knows that he can't
corrupt Lucretia by his paltry presents and ridiculous condescension.</p>

<p>They would send her back to Salzburg, if they dared,&mdash;anyhow,
Baroness von Tisch is to be both Chief Mistress
and confidential secretary. If she died of the first confidence
I make her, she wouldn't live five minutes.</p>

<p>The King's House Marshal, Baron von Carlowitz, came
to announce the change to me, but I knew, of course, that
it was George's doings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell Prince George," I said icily, "that I appreciate
the fact of being deprived of the services of an honest
woman in favor of a spy."</p>

<p>I will "show" this Tisch woman, as my American
friends say. Some three years ago Emperor Francis Joseph
appointed a spy as attendant to my brother Leopold.
Schoenstein, Baron or Count, was his name, I think.
Schoenstein would rather bear evil tales of his young master
to his old master than eat, and nothing would please
him better than to meddle with Leopold's correspondence.</p>

<p>He stole as many letters as he could lay his hands on.
Fished them even from slop-pails, or pieced together such
as Leopold tore up and dropped in the cuspidors. When
brother observed this, he used to tear up bills and the most
innocent writings of his own and other people into little
bits and planted them in Schoenstein's hunting-grounds.
Appropriate work for a <i>lick-spittle</i> to pull them out. But
Leopold got tired of playing with this vermin, and it
tickled him to make an example of the scamp. Hence, he
allowed it to be observed by Schoenstein when he, Leopold,
locked a parcel of letters from his girl in the cash-box.</p>

<p>The toad-eating Schoenstein burned with desire to copy
these letters and send the transcript on to Emperor Francis
Joseph. They would have made interesting reading to my
old uncle who has given up cracking nuts since his teeth
fell out. There is Kati Schratt, you say. Pshaw, Kati is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
as old, or nearly as old, as his Majesty and she isn't a
Ninon de l'Enclos by any means.</p>

<p>To cut a long story short, Schoenstein could see but
one way for getting those compromising letters: steal the
keys and borrow the parcel for a short while. That's what
Leopold was waiting for. Not half an hour after the keys
had been abstracted, he raised the alarm. He had been
"robbed." The archducal safe had been rifled. And he
managed to catch Schoenstein red-handed.</p>

<p>"Send for the police," thundered my brother, "and
meanwhile watch the thief well." Schoenstein was given no
chance to explain and deemed himself lucky to escape arrest.
My brother suspended him from service and made
him go to a hotel while he telegraphed the story of the
attempted theft to Vienna, asking the Count's immediate
dismissal.</p>

<p>Of course, Vienna disavowed the dunderhead&mdash;royalty
has no use for persons that allow themselves to be compromised&mdash;and
he has been in disgrace ever since. Nor
can he get another courtly office, for Leopold threatened
the moment he sees him with a Highness to warn everybody:
"Look to your watch and purse, we have a thief
with us."</p>

<h4>BANISHMENT</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I am ordered to repair to a country house with the hated spy as
my Grand Mistress&mdash;My first impulse to go home, but afraid
parents won't have me.</p></div>


<p>

</p>

<p>Order from the King that myself and children spend
the rest of the summer at Villa Loschwitz, to remain until
I get royal permission to return to Dresden,&mdash;the Tisch to
act as chief of my household.</p>

<p>Banished! I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
Smile, because I escaped the <i>ennui</i> of attending court at
the summer residence of Pillnitz; weep, because my absence
from court would be interpreted as a disciplinary measure.</p>

<p>I know Pillnitz is about as gay as a Trappist feast
of carrion and ant's milk, but this princess doesn't want to
be disciplined.</p>

<p>I shall tell them that I want to go home, but will they
have me in Salzburg? Papa, of course, but if mother hears
of my acquaintance with Heine, "who doesn't love Jesus,"&mdash;her
own words,&mdash;she will undoubtedly side with Prince
George against her daughter. It was Heine who wrote of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
one of her ancestors, King Louis of Bavaria: "As soon
as the monkeys and kangaroos are converted to Christianity,
they'll make King Louis their guardian saint, in proof
of their perfect sanity." And you don't suppose for a moment
that mamma forgets a thing like that. As to Nietzsche,
he will give her no conscientious qualms, for I'm sure
she never heard of the gentleman, but my going to the
Gipsy Baron "where two princely mistresses are gyrating"&mdash;horrible!</p>

<p>I hear her say: "I think Prince George is most considerate
sending our daughter to Loschwitz. She deserved
to be put in a nunnery and made to kneel on unboiled peas
three times a day." And when it comes to an <i>&eacute;clat</i>, even
papa may have to abandon me. Emperor Francis Joseph
holds the purse-strings; and papa always lives beyond his
means and Francis Joseph, King Albert and Prince George
are fast friends. If papa quarrelled with the two latter
gentlemen, they would immediately denounce him to the
Emperor. The rest can easily be guessed.</p>

<p>Sorry, but papa is no hero in his daughter's eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 33em;">Villa Loschwitz</span>, <i>September 1, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Father had to give in. He is the poor relation, and
a poor relation in royal circles doesn't amount to more than
one among well-to-do merchants and farmers. He has no
rights that others need respect and if he shows backbone
he is given to understand that the head of the family has
other uses for the palace or hunting grounds lent him.</p>

<p>"I would love to have you with me in Salzburg," he
wrote, "but, dear child, it's for your best to learn to obey.
Do it for your old father's sake."</p>

<p>Still I wouldn't give in at once. "I won't go to Loschwitz,"
I declared. And gave a dozen reasons besides the
paramount one that I wouldn't go, because Prince George
wanted me.</p>

<p>"I'm no trunk to be shipped hither and thither at
someone's behest," I said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick Augustus took umbrage at the "someone,"
which he pronounced <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</i>, and to emphasise the
fact hit the table with a bang, whereupon I pounded the
table twice: bang-bang!</p>

<p>It hurt my hand, and didn't do Frederick Augustus
any good. Nor was the discussion advanced thereby. For
the rest: an exchange of names and epithets that smacked
of the kitchen rather than the <i>salon</i>.</p>

<p>"Too bad you exhaust all your energy with me," I said
among other things, "while in the royal presence you act
the docile lamb's tail."</p>

<p>He began prating about his character as an army
officer again, and I reminded him that I wasn't the Countess
Cosel.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" asked the big ignoramus.</p>

<p>"Never heard of the lady that refused to accompany
Augustus to the Camp of M&uuml;hlberg unless he brought her
a certain intimate golden vessel costing five thousand
<i>Thalers</i>?"</p>

<p>"A loving cup?" asked my husband.</p>

<p>"If you like to call it so."</p>

<p>"But why did you say you are no Cosel?"</p>

<p>"I meant to imply that I am not a prisoner of state
and don't want to be treated like one. Hence, since a visit
to my parents would greatly embarrass them, I decided to
go to Brighton for the season."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brighton," he repeated, "and where will you get the
spondulicks?"</p>

<p>"I saved up quite a bit of money. Guess I can manage
the expense alright."</p>

<p>"Lip-music," cried Frederick Augustus in his polite
way. "You have no idea what such a trip costs."</p>

<p>I assured him that I had made every inquiry and was
able to meet all expenses. "We will go incog.," I added,
"the babies and nurse and Lucretia. The Tisch woman
shall have a furlough even before she asks for it."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" Frederick Augustus laughed brutally.
"You seem to forget that you are subject to our house
laws."</p>

<p>"And you seem to forget that I have a will of my
own," I almost shouted.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus jumped up. "Not another word
on the subject," he commanded. "The incident is closed."</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to me that Prince George had
been talking once more to Frederick Augustus about the
pugilistic performances of my mother. Perhaps he was
trying to pluck up courage to beat me, a diversion not
altogether unknown in the House of Saxony, according
to the Memoirs of the famous Baron Schweinichen, Court
Marshal and <i>Chroniqueur</i>.</p>

<p>His diaries, covering a number of years, have many
such entries as this: "His Royal Highness hit the Prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>cess
a good one on the 'snout' by way of silencing her
tongue." Doubtless George would be delighted to have
me "shut up" by some such process, but Frederick Augustus
lacks the sand.</p>

<p>When he was gone, I indicted a letter to the King,
advising him in oily, malicious, yet eminently respectful
language that, not wishing to figure as a prisoner of state,
I had decided to spend the rest of the summer abroad with
my children. At the same time I intimated that I was well
aware of being in disgrace and being regarded with ill
favor by the several members of the royal family.</p>

<p>"If it pleases your Majesty," I added, "I will relieve
a most unhappy situation by giving back his liberty to
Frederick Augustus. I'll promise not to oppose divorce,
or allow my family to interfere."</p>

<p>This letter I sent to the King, sealing it with my
personal arms, of which there is no duplicate at court.
After that I sent three telegrams. One to papa, announcing
that I was going to Brighton; another to the Palace Hotel
in Brighton; a third to the Minister of Railways, commanding
that my saloon carriage be coupled to the Continental
express night after next. I knew, of course, that the King
would be informed of these messages in a twinkling.</p>

<p>I waited an hour for the Powers to move; as a rule
it takes them a week or ten days. Exactly sixty-five minutes
after sending my letter to the King, Frederick Augus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>tus
rode into the courtyard like a madman. He had been
hurriedly summoned from the drill-grounds, I heard afterwards.
He dismounted at the stairs leading to the King's
apartments. Half an hour later, he slunk into my room, as
serious as a corpse. There wasn't a trace of brutality in
his voice as he said:</p>

<p>"A fine row you kicked up."</p>

<p>I didn't favor him by questions, but kept looking out
of the window. He walked up and down for five or six
minutes, boring his eyes into the corners of the room.
Suddenly, at a safe distance, he delivered himself of the
following:</p>

<p>"His Majesty interdicts your plans <i>in toto</i>. You will
be conducted to Loschwitz tonight. Don't put yourself
to the humiliation of trying to disobey. You are being
watched."</p>

<p>"His Majesty's own words?"</p>

<p>"He refused to see me," answered Frederick Augustus,
dejectedly. He acted as if pronouncing his own death
warrant. "Baumann told me." (This is the King's Secretary.)</p>

<p>I almost pitied the poor fellow, but I had to hold my
own.</p>

<p>"My dear Frederick Augustus," I said, "you can tell
Baumann from me that I won't go to Loschwitz tonight;
that for the present I intend to stay here and that, if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
force me, they'll need plenty of rope, for I will holler and
kick and do all I can to attract attention."</p>

<p>Maybe Frederick Augustus wanted to say something
in reply, but open his mouth was all he could manage.
Seeing him so bamboozled, I continued: "It is decided,
then, that I stay, but I give you fair warning that I will
skip to England sooner or later. I don't want you to get
into trouble, Frederick Augustus, therefore inform Baumann
without delay."</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus got blue in the face. He seemed
ready to jump on me, crush me between his cuirassier fists.
I held up my hand.</p>

<p>"Did Baumann tell you that I offered to accept divorce
if it pleases the King?"</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus changed color. White as a ghost,
he fixed his eyes upon mine, momentarily, and murmured:
"Have we got to that point?"</p>

<p>He ran out of the room and a minute later was tearing
up the stairs leading to the King's apartments. Lucretia
says he returned within a quarter of an hour and
tried my door. But I had locked myself in and refused
to open. We didn't meet until dinner. Neither of us ate
a bite, or said a word. Baumann was announced with the
ice. He was all smiles, all devotion.</p>

<p>"His Majesty will be pleased to see your Imperial
Highness in a quarter of an hour," he said sweetly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick Augustus was a painted sepulchre when I
coolly replied: "Pray inform His Majesty that I am not
well and about to retire for the night."</p>

<p>At this Baumann looked like a whipped dog. He
probably thought it impossible for anyone to refuse to
answer the summons of His Majesty. With the most downcast
mien in the world, he seemed singularly anxious to
render himself ridiculous. "Maybe the Crown Prince will
do in my stead," I suggested maliciously.</p>

<p>Baumann grabbed at the straw and withdrew. A little
while later a lackey came, summoning Frederick Augustus
to Prince George. When he came back, he was all undone.</p>

<p>"Father treated me very well," he said. "He says the
King regrets that your uncontrollable temper causes so
many misunderstandings, and both His Majesty and father
have no objection to your staying in Dresden if you like.
Loschwitz was suggested because you and the children
seem to need country air.</p>

<p>"As to your proposed visit to England, the King begs
you to consider that such a journey at this time is liable
to provoke a scandal which would reflect not only on you,
on us, but on your poor parents."</p>

<p>The old story of the penurious relations, I thought
bitterly, but on the whole I was well pleased. I had beaten
and out-generaled them all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"If Loschwitz isn't meant for punishment, I accept
with pleasure," I said. "It's a very pretty place." Poor
Frederick Augustus' face lit up. "But there must be an
end to the talk about I being in disgrace. If the King is
as friendly to me as he makes out, let him come and see
me and the babies. As to summonses by Baumann or
others, I won't accept them."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Frederick Augustus, and I saw that
I had risen mile-high in his estimation, "when will it be
your pleasure to leave for Loschwitz?"</p>

<p>"Tonight, if I have permission to invite Leopold for a
week or so."</p>

<p>"Are you stark, staring mad?" shouted my husband,&mdash;"Impose
conditions after the King moderated?"</p>

<p>"Go and tell Baumann I'll have Leopold or all is off,"
I said.</p>

<p>Next morning: Ceremonial visit from the Queen.
The tip of her nose was redder than ever and she seemed
prepared to weep at the flicking of an eye-lash. She gave
me a list of her troubles, mental, physical, political, matrimonial
and otherwise, since the day she was born, but said:
"Obedience to my father, the King, and obedience to my
husband, the King, has enabled me to weather all storms.
You, too, must learn obedience, Louise. It's women's only
salvation and especially a princess's."</p>

<p>I answered that I fully recognized my obligations to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
the King. "I only object to being buffeted around like a
piece of furniture."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," said the Queen, "and hope all is
arranged satisfactorily. The King will be glad if you
invite your parents to Loschwitz."</p>

<p>"I asked permission to invite Leopold."</p>

<p>"But, no doubt, your parents would take more interest
in the children than your brother."</p>

<p>"I don't dispute that, Your Majesty. But if my parents
joined me at the present time, people might think they
came to condole with me or else to scold me. I want
Leopold."</p>

<p>The Queen said she wouldn't dare mention Leopold to
His Majesty.</p>

<p>"Well, then," I concluded, "I shall stay in Dresden,
regarding Baumann's fine promises as mere talk."</p>

<p>The Queen went away with the air of a martyr, but
three days later Baumann came and said His Imperial
Highness was welcome.</p>

<p>A triumph all along the line. I left Dresden without
seeing the King.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus is at the man&oelig;uvres.</p>

<p>The Baroness is acting as my Grand Mistress.</p>

<h4>A SERVANT-TYRANT</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My correspondence is not safe from the malicious woman appointed
Grand Mistress&mdash;Lovers at a distance and by correspondence&mdash;Fell

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>September 8, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Baroness Tisch, now that she attained the height of
her ambition, is beginning to show her claws. She is an
infernal cat. Her skinniness makes her repulsive to me
and her face gives everyone the impression that she just
sucked an enormous lemon. She lisps and that makes me
nervous. I feel like aping her when she isn't around.</p>

<p>She's after me like the devil chasing a poor soul and
as I never address her except to command or reprimand,
she tries to find out any secret doings, or thinkings, I may
be guilty of by way of letters I write or receive.</p>

<p>According to the laws of most countries private correspondence
is sacred, legally and morally. The late Field-Marshal,
Count Blumenthal, wrote to his wife of the Crown
Prince, afterwards Emperor Frederick, that he was a "d&mdash;&mdash;
fool," but "as communications between husband and wife
are privileged," no official cognizance was taken.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>Otherwise in this petty kingdom and, as already told,
in Austria, whose monarch, in family matters at least,
holds to the "<i>L'Etat c'est moi</i>" maxim.</p>

<p>The King's spy, the Tisch, constituted herself post-office
of Villa Loschwitz&mdash;a duty appertaining to her rank&mdash;and
I wager she works the "<i>Black Cabinet</i>" to perfection.
Of course, I am now careful in all I write and advise my
friends to be, but I sometimes get letters from Unknowns,
people that sympathize with me or have fallen in love with
me. All women in high station have lovers among the
lowly. I recall the Cardinal Dubois' yarn about Salvatico,
envoy of the Prince of Modena, my kinsman of yore. The
Italian was sent to Paris to conduct home his master's
lovely intended, <i>Mademoiselle</i> de Valois, daughter of the
Regent. It happened that the emissary was introduced to
<i>Mademoiselle's</i> room an hour before the time set, when she
was lying on a lounge "with one leg, almost naked, hanging
down." Salvatico fell in love with the leg and exhausted
himself in so many "Ah, ah's" of admiration and other
love-sick stunts that the Duke of Richelieu, having older
rights, said to him: "Rogue, if you had your deserts I
would cut off your two ears!"</p>

<p>No man, except my husband, has seen my legs, which
is a pity, perhaps, but the extreme <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> demanded at
certain court functions, especially in Berlin, gained me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
many epistolary lovers, whose homage I accept gracefully,
but in silence, of course.</p>

<p>Still, a malicious thing like the Tisch, if one gives her
enough rope, might arrange, on paper at least, to get me
with child by a Lothario a hundred miles off, even as the
children of Madame de Montespan and Louis XIV were
credited to the Marquis, her husband, residing a hundred
leagues away, at Guienne. Let me find her red-handed and
she will fare even worse than Schoenstein.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h4>MORE TYRANNY OF A TITLED SERVANT</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My daily papers seized, and only milk-and-water clippings are

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>September 10, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>This morning there were no newspapers at the usual
hour. Instead, the Tisch furnished a heap of clippings
carefully pasted up&mdash;the veriest milk-and-water slush
"ever." Instanter I sent for my tormentor.</p>

<p>"What's this?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"Today's papers, Your Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>"You made these clippings?"</p>

<p>"At Your Imperial Highness's commands."</p>

<p>"And you think me ninny enough to be satisfied with
reading no more than what you consider proper for me
to see?"</p>

<p>The Tisch wavered not a bit. "His Majesty the King
is served the same fashion."</p>

<p>"No matter. I want my papers whole, and don't you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
dare to mutilate them." By way of letting her down easier
I added: "Don't give yourself the trouble."</p>

<p>"No trouble, I assure your Imperial Highness. With
your permission, then, I will continue to clip for Your
Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>I rose and, measuring her from head to toe with flaming
eyes, I said: "You will do nothing of the kind, do you
understand?"</p>

<p>The impertinent cat insisted: "But I think it
proper&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you heard what I said or not, Baroness?"</p>

<p>She tried to save her face by asserting, "I am acting
by command of His Majesty."</p>

<p>"I will ask His Majesty whether you spoke the truth,"
I said quick as a flash; "meanwhile you are suspended and
will return to Dresden until recalled. Ring the bell and I
will give orders to the Master of Horse to send you away."</p>

<p>Of course Tisch couldn't afford such an inquiry to be
made, which would have exposed her clumsy hand and,
as remarked, royalty doesn't care to be found out. Defeat
staring her in the face, Tisch wavered: "Of course, if
your Imperial Highness chooses to take the responsibility,
I will be most happy to submit the papers as they arrive."</p>

<p>"In their wrappers," I commanded, as I dismissed her.</p>

<p>By distributing a hundred marks in silver, I found out
that the Tisch examines my body-servants daily and that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
night after night, she sits up hours writing long-winded
reports. She is the King's tool, but she let the cat out of

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>September 15, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Leopold is with me, the brother two years older than
I. They just made him a Major&mdash;a twelve-month later than
his patent calls for.</p>

<p>Like myself, he is almost permanently in disgrace with
the head of the family, even as I am with the King and
Prince George. We had no sooner embraced and kissed,
than I asked him for the latest gossip concerning the Crown
Princess of Saxony.</p>

<p>"You are a tough one," he said, shaking his finger with
amused mockery. According to Vienna court gossip, "I
threw Prince George out of doors," when he "raised
his hand against me," Frederick Augustus and my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>self
haven't been on speaking terms for six months; and
the Saxe family was actually considering the advisability
of divorce.</p>

<p>Of course I told Leopold how things really are.</p>

<p>"Then there will be no divorce?" he asked.</p>

<p>"If the King and Prince George leave me alone,&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Too bad," he said with a laugh, "that knocks me out
of the pleasure of maintaining my <i>thesis</i> that the founder
of the Christian religion didn't believe in indissoluble marriage,
but, on the contrary, in divorce if such couldn't be
avoided."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Professor Wahrmund is preparing a paper on the subject,"
said Leopold, who, as remarked, is a very well-read
chap and a student. He named five or six emperors and
kings, Catholics, some of them members of the Austrian
Imperial family, who obtained divorces, or married divorced
women. I jotted down the list.</p>

<p>Lothair II divorced his wife Theutberga and married
his love, Waldrade.</p>

<p>Emperor Frederick I divorced the Empress Anna on
the plea that she was sterile. She married a Count, with
whom she had a dozen children.</p>

<p>Margaret, a daughter of Leopold VI of Austria, was
divorced by King Ottokar of Bohemia.</p>

<p>John Henry, Prince of Bohemia, divorced his wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Margareta, who afterwards married an ancestor of the
Kaiser, Ludwig of Brandenburg.</p>

<p>King Ladislaus of Sicily divorced Queen Constance and
forced his vassal, Andrea di Capua, to marry her against
his will. Ten years later Ladislaus married Maria de
Lusignan.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>But a little knowledge is a terrible thing, if it happens
to be acquired by a prince. Princes are supposed to know
nothing but the art and the <i>finesses</i> of destruction&mdash;war.
Upbuilding is not in their line.</p>

<p>"I hear you are exercising a bad influence on Louise,"
roared our uncle, the Emperor, at Leopold when the latter
took leave from him. "You furnished to her those infernal
books, sowing the seed of guilty knowledge?"</p>

<p>Leopold so far forgot himself as to address a question
to the "All-Highest": "What infernal books?"</p>

<p>"Books full of indecencies and obscenities, in short

turned his horse and rode away in high dudgeon. Royal
arguments are nothing if not one-sided!</p>

<p>Then Leopold told of himself. His garrison: a filthy
mud-hole in Poland. One-story houses and everybody peeping
into everybody else's windows. The few notables of
the town and neighborhood tickled to death because they
have an Imperial Highness with them, and the fool of an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
Imperial Highness goes and "besots himself with a mere
country lass." He showed me her photograph. I like her
looks. A pretty face, blonde hair and soft eyes. He was
her first lover. On his account she left her family. She
dotes on him as a dog dotes on his master.</p>

<p>Leopold is eccentric enough to jeopardize his career
for this poor thing. He rented a small house for her and
spends much of his time there when not on the drill-grounds.</p>

<p>Hence intense indignation among the "respectable
ladies." An Imperial Highness within reach and he "doesn't
come to our dances, he doesn't visit and sends his regrets
when invited!"</p>

<p>Poor Marja suffers especially from the venom of the
officers' wives,&mdash;cattle I detest. No royal or imperial prince
is safe from them except in his mother's womb.</p>

<p>"From morn till night and half the night they do nothing
but gossip about me and my girl," said Leopold,&mdash;"If
the cats were only satisfied with that! But every little
while I get an anonymous letter from one of them, denouncing
her; Marja is favored in a similar way; so is
my general and our uncle, the Emperor."</p>

<p>And needless to say Leopold can't get along on his
salary and appanage. Father can't give him much. The
Emperor won't, because the clergy intrigues against him
as a free-thinker and non-church-goer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>We thought long and deep whether it wouldn't be possible
to improve our position and we decided on this:</p>

<p>We will keep up each other's spirits by clandestine
correspondence, carried on with the aid of a mutual friend.
At the same time we will, apparently, fall in with the ideas
of "our masters" and endure a few pin-pricks rather than
waste our strength in useless opposition.</p>

<p>Let no one chide us for hypocrites, because our gentleness
will be a mask, our submission a snare, our obedience
a lie. It's all on the outside. Inwardly Leopold and
Louise will remain true to themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<h4>FREDERICK AUGUSTUS CONTINUES VERY RAW</h4>

</p>

<p>I have tried it a fortnight during Frederick Augustus'
sojourn here, and, like the French Countess who fell in
love with the strong man of the circus, I am disappointed.
Frederick Augustus considers my tractability <i>carte blanche</i>
to carry into the boudoir of an Imperial Princess the license
of the brothel. He treats me like a kept-woman&mdash;all with
the utmost good-nature. I am called names such as the
other Augustus bestowed on the mothers of his three hundred
and fifty-two, and I daren't remind him that some day
I'll be Queen of these realms.</p>

<p>This prince, like the majority of them, hasn't the ghost
of an idea of a sensitive woman's nature. He paws me over
like a prize cow, and as the fourteenth Louis esteemed his
mistress's chamber-women no more worthy of notice than
her lap-dogs, so Frederick Augustus makes love <i>&agrave; la</i> bar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>racks
before the Schoenberg, Countess von Minckwitz, or
whatever other lady is in attendance.</p>

<p>Only when he does it before the Tisch I am inclined
to be amused rather than incensed. Tisch, cadaverous
beanpole, never felt a loving touch on her shoulder.
The place where her bosom should be never experienced
a friendly squeeze. No one ever cared whether she wore
silk stockings or rubber boots&mdash;be amorous, Frederick
Augustus, when the Tisch is 'round! Indulge
your coarseness! Put twenty-mark pieces in my stockings
for a kiss. Tell gay stories and don't forget playing with
my corsage. It will make the old woman mad. It will
remind her of what she missed&mdash;of what she will miss all
her life!</p>

<p>He is paying banal compliments to the noble-women

one in a corner&mdash;and they seem to live in corners when His

<p>Prince Max called on me the day of my arrival and
promised me an armchair in Paradise for "reforming" Leopold.
"I understand that your family life is ideal now,"
he added. "What bliss!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Louise," he continued, with the face of a donkey
withdrawing his nozzle from a syrup barrel, "whenever
doubtful of the right way, of the Lord's way, come to me."</p>

<p>It would have been un-politic to repulse the grotesque
ape, and I said: "I will. I will even give you the preference
over the Kaiser, who asked me the same thing&mdash;as
<i>summus episcopus</i>, of course."</p>

<p>Max looked about the room. We were alone, yet he
lowered his voice to a faint whisper. "William is a heretic.
Don't trust him in religious matters," he breathed stealthily.
And this devilish Max began to stroke my hands and admire
a bracelet I wore above the elbow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick Augustus, half insane with delight, pinched
my arm and squeezed my leg under the table. I felt like
boxing his ears.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Dresden</span>, <i>November 20, 1894</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Lover No. two. Very much in earnest, like the first,
but I&mdash;extremely distant this time, though I accepted some
emeralds and sapphires as big as dove's eggs. The Shah of
Persia is the happy-unhappy man.</p>

<p>The King and all the Princes went to the railway station
to receive him. The Queen and Princesses, our entourage
behind us, assembled in the throne room to do
honor to the "animal." To designate him otherwise would
be callow flattery.</p>

<p>But his diamonds and rubies fairly dazzled us. Nothing
like it in Europe, and our gala uniforms, compared with
his, like stage tiaras to the Russian Crown jewels!</p>

<p>Though he had eyes for me only, I didn't like him a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
bit. He is a little fellow, unsecure on his pins. And like
the Balkan princeling I met in Vienna, looks as though
there was a strain of Jewish blood in his veins.</p>

<p>Like a true Oriental potentate, he wasted not a minute's
time on the Queen and my sisters-in-law, but began
making love to me as soon as he entered. The King had
to take him by the arm to remind him that his first greetings
were due to her Majesty. Poor Carola! Her face
looked like parchment, much interlined, and the point of
her nose was as conspicuous as usual.</p>

<p>There's nothing elegant about this "King of kings,"
and his French, like his manners, is atrocious. He addressed
a few set phrases to the Queen, then attacked me&mdash;"attacked"
is the right word. If I hadn't been on the
defensive, I think he would have handled my charms as
unceremoniously as Frederick Augustus when in his cups.
As it was I escaped but by the length of an eye-lash.</p>

<p>State dinner at five. I never saw such an ill-behaved
brute, yet he intended to be most agreeable. We are very
pious at this court, but on occasions like this even an old
woman like the Queen is obliged to denude herself like a
wet-nurse on duty.</p>

<p>His Majesty had the Queen on one side; me on the
left. The King of Saxony was opposite.</p>

<p>After we sat down the Shah examined Queen Carola
from the point of her chin to the edge of her desolate cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>sage
and had the effrontery to express disapproval in all
but words. Then he turned to me. His gaze became admiring.
He was evidently delighted with his discoveries
and, true despot that he is, turned his back on the Queen,
while paying extravagant court to my charms.</p>

<p>The King, the whole vast assembly, the surrounding
splendor were lost on this mutton-eater of a barbarian.
He saw only me, <i>m-e</i>, ME, and I'm sure would have consigned
all the rest to some unspeakable Oriental death for
five minutes' <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with Louise.</p>

<p>"You are neglecting Her Majesty," I whispered to
him over and over again. This seemed to enrage him, but
at last he turned to the Queen, expecting her to begin a
conversation with him. Of course, Her Majesty thought
he would take the initiative, which led to mutual staring,
the Shah's eyes growing wickeder every second. Then he
began to devote himself to the food and, be sure, there was
small pleasure in watching him. He fed more like a dog
than a human being and actually had the effrontery to wipe
his sauce-spattered hands in the lap of my state robe.</p>

<p>Then, before his mouth was empty, he began talking
again.</p>

<p>"Which of the princes is your husband?"</p>

<p>I singled out Frederick Augustus. "He isn't a beauty
by any means," he said, after examining him like a horse
for sale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>The next second his eyes were wandering over my
body; I felt as if I was being disrobed.</p>

<p>"You will attend the opera?"</p>

<p>"I'll have the honor."</p>

<p>"I will send you a little present after dinner," he said.
"If you wear it tonight, I will regard that as a sign of
hope." The beast affected a sentimentality to which he
must be a stranger.</p>

<p>I recalled that he was the monster who carpeted the
steps of his throne with the gouged-out eyes of ten thousand
enemies of his r&eacute;gime when he was crowned. On
twenty-thousand human eyes he trod with naked feet as
he acclaimed himself "King of kings" and the "true son of
God." And Juggernaut was in love with me!</p>

<p>I was speechless. Did he take me for a dancing girl?
I narrowed my shoulders and gave him a look of disdain.
House Marshal Baron Carlowitz, standing behind the King's
chair, took in the situation and whispered to King Albert.</p>

<p>The King immediately rose from table and the state
dinner came to an abrupt end.</p>

<p>An hour later, while I was dressing for the theatre,
a big jewel box was handed in. "From the Shah."</p>

<p>Despite my disgust with the fellow, I opened it in
feverish haste. There was a bracelet set with rubies, sapphires
and emeralds of fabulous size.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>I am in disgrace again and that uncouth animal, the
Shah, is responsible.</p>

<p>The dinner episode was bad enough, but he carried
on worse at the grand parade next day.</p>

<p>Six or eight regiments, Horse, Foot and Artillery, had
been moved to do him honor, but he flatly refused to accept
a mount for the occasion. Like the ladies of the royal
family, he drove to the parade field in a coach and four,
and no sooner did he clap eyes on me at the rendezvous
in another vehicle than he left his and shambled over to
me. He stood at the carriage door, chanting love and devotion,
and if I hadn't been all ice, I have no doubt he
would have jumped in and ordered the coachman to drive
to a hotel.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King trotted around the man&oelig;uvre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
field in honor of his "sublime guest." Evolutions, <i>Parade-marsch</i>,
attacks, saluting the colors, Persian and Saxon,
what not? Imagine the feelings of the old King when he
rode up to the Shah's gala coach and found it empty.</p>

<p>The marching past had begun, and still the "King of
kings" turned his back on it all, while trying to persuade
me to be Queen of his seraglio.</p>

<p>Our courtiers, the princes, the Queen, the generals were
in despair. They took counsel with each other, disputed,
advised, got red in the face. The Shah's gentlemen alone
kept cool. They probably argued: If our master prefers
the company of a pretty woman to looking at ten
thousand men, he shows his good taste.</p>

<p>I tried to shake him off. He stood his ground and
smiled.</p>

<p>"The Grand March has begun, Your Majesty."</p>

<p>"Bother the Grand March."</p>

<p>The King began to bombard me with ungracious,
glances, and of course everybody stared. Three times I
asked the big booby to return to his carriage to oblige his
host. "Not while I may look at you, adored one."</p>

<p>His love-making became desperate. The Crown Princess
of Saxony, the Imperial Highness of Austria, the
"adored one" of this butcher, who was ruining twenty-five
thousand marks' worth of carpets in his apartments at our
palace by using them as a shambles to prepare his breakfast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
of lamb stew. It was contemptible,&mdash;nay, ridiculous. Surely
there was nothing to do but laugh. And I laughed and
laughed again.</p>

<p>Only when the last battalion had marched by and the
music ceased, the "King of kings" returned to his carriage
and drove back to Dresden with the most bored looking
visage of the world.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>January 5, 1895</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Ever since the Shah left I have been the object of
criticism, suspicions and down-right attacks by the pretty
family I married into. These pages witness that I tried to
conform to the absurd notions and comply with the narrow-minded
idiosyncrasies of the Royal Wettiners. I give
it up. It can't be done, and I won't make another effort at
pleasing my relatives-in-law, who adjudge laughter a crime
and the desire to make friends a bid of lewdness.</p>

<p>Prince George invented the phrase, "Louise is over-desirous
to please," and Queen Carola paid me a state visit
to acquaint me with the new indictment.</p>

<p>"Good gracious," I said to Her Majesty, "is that all?
I thought of being accused of 'sassing' the Archangel Gabriel.
As to desire to please, that's exactly what ails me.
I love to please. I love to see people happy. I love to
make friends."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear child," said the Queen, "you haven't the
slightest notion of royal dignity. You talk like a <i>cocotte</i>.
It's a Princess's place to be honored, to be held in supreme
esteem."</p>

<p>Poor old woman! She was never pretty, never was
made love to, never had admirers, legitimate or otherwise; she
thus became impregnated with the fixed idea that to be
fair and to be loved for one's fairness is frivolous, if not
altogether reprehensible.</p>

</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus drinks. He says I drive him to drink
by my attitude towards his beloved family. What
the beloved family does to me doesn't count, of course.</p>

<p>Drinking was one of the vices of his youth. Love
for me cured him of the dreadful habit. As this love
wanes, the itch for alcohol increases.</p>

<p>I can't do anything with him when he is drunk, and
at such times I am afraid of him. He both nauseates me
and frightens me. Sometimes he comes home "fighting
drunk." The fumes of wine, beer and <i>Schnapps</i>, mixed
with tobacco, upset my stomach and I try to avoid his
coarse embrace as any decent woman would.</p>

<p>What does this royal drill-ground bully do? He unsheathes
his sword and threatens to cut my liver out, unless
I instantly doff my clothes and go to bed with him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>Prince George's evil counsel wasn't powerful enough
to procure me beatings, but my husband's military education,
his love of discipline, backed by alcohol, thrusts a
sword into his hand, and, if I refuse to comply with his
atrocious demands, I am liable to be treated like so many
"mere" civilians that are sabred in the public streets for
refusing to do some spurred and epauletted blackguard's
bidding, or entertain his insults.</p>

<p>If the Socialists, who are forever railing against these
self-same army poltroons, only knew it! An Imperial Highness
threatened like a small "cit" with a four-foot sword
in the hand of a drunken Royal Highness and dragged
to a couch with no more ceremony than a street-walker
passing a Cossack barracks!</p>

<p>The howl that would go up in the Diet, or the <i>Reichstag</i>,
the fulminant denials by prince and king and government!
And if I really did get hurt in one of these fracases,
Frederick Augustus would be sure of a "severe
reprimand" by father and uncle, and perhaps by the Kaiser,
too, but would that heal my wounds, would it save me from
death? Would it even prevent Prince George from saying
that I myself was to blame?</p>

<p>No, no, I like a whole skin and prefer an embrace
to a sword-thrust any day, like my ancestress, the Queen
of Naples, who consummated the marriage forced upon
her on the spot and in sight of the army rather than have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>

<h4>PRISON FOR PRINCES THAT OPPOSE THE KING</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Duke of Saxony banished&mdash;Cut off from good literature even&mdash;Anecdote

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>September 1, 1895</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I have once more come to the conclusion that the
agreement I made with Leopold, to dissimulate my real
feelings, was the sanest decision I ever formed, for, while
<i>lettres de cachet</i> are a dead measure as far as ordinary
mortals go, kings still wield that awful and mysterious abuse
of power in the family circle.</p>

<p>There is a distant connection of our "sublime master,"
the King, lingering, without process of law, in a state
prison. Duke of Saxony is his title, and he is quite
rich in his own right. Some six or eight years ago
he raised his hand against the King after the latter struck
him.</p>

<p>It was suggested that he had better make away with
himself, and a revolver and poison were conspicuously displayed
in the room where he was held captive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke said "nay." He thought he could "brass"
it out. But the assembled family council taught him that,
while the world at large was <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i>, royalty still lived
in the traditions of the eighteenth century. It empowered
the King to banish his kinsman to a lonely country house,
styled castle by courtesy, and he is confined there even
today, with the proviso, though, that he may use the surrounding
hunting-grounds. Otherwise he lives in complete
seclusion, separated not only from all his friends, but from
the very classes of society to which he belongs by birth
and education. And he is still a young man.</p>

<p>I believe they are trying to drive him mad, once as a
punishment, and again to secure his fortune the quicker.
To the latter end, he is denied all books that give him
pleasure and are liable to improve his mind. Bibles, Christian
Heralds, the Lives of the Martyrs, or the Popes, galore,
but never a Carlyle, Shakespeare or Taine, which he
demands regularly.</p>

<p>The Duke is dying of <i>ennui</i>, they say, and to kill time
engages in all sorts of manual labor. When he gets tired
of that he blows the trombone.</p>

<p>"Of course he would prefer a pair of kettledrums,"
said my cousin Bernhardt of Weimar, to whom I am indebted
for the above.</p>

<p>"Kettledrums?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I mean those the Grand Dauphin, called 'Son of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
king, father of a king, never a king,' was so fond of, and
which he finally married in secret."</p>

<p>I looked bewildered.</p>

<p>"You are a very ignorant girl," said Bernhardt. "Never
heard of the prodigious bosoms of <i>Mademoiselle</i> Chouin?"</p>

<p>"They won't let the Duke marry?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Not even temporarily," said Bernhardt. "And they
are trying the same game on me. My garrison&mdash;a dung-heap.
The people there, males and females, entirely unacquainted
with soap and water. Nothing in the world to
do but drink and gamble."</p>

<p>"That reminds me. What are you doing in Dresden?"</p>

<p>"With Your Imperial Highness's permission, I came
to see my girl."</p>

<p>"Who is the lady?"</p>

<p>"No lady at all. Just an ordinary servant-wench, but
prettier and more devilish than a hundred of them."</p>

<p>"Bernhardt!"</p>

<p>"What would you have me do, Louise? I haven't
money enough to keep a mistress, and King and Queen
certainly won't keep one for me. I wish I had lived a
hundred and fifty years ago, when every lady of the court
was expected to entertain the royal princes, the Palace
footing the bill."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<h4>PRINCE GEORGE SHOWN THE DOOR BY GRAND-DUCHESS MELITA</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A royal lady who walks her garden attired in a single diaphanous
garment&mdash;Won't stand for any meddling&mdash;Called impertinent&mdash;My
virtuous indignation assumed&mdash;A flirtation at a

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>February 5, 1896</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>At last Prince George got his deserts, and got 'em good
and heavy. There had been rumors for some time that
Grand-duke Ernest Ludwig and his bride, Victoria Melita
of Saxe-Coburg, the English branch, didn't get along together.
Ernest Ludwig is a serious-minded, modest and
intelligent man, but a good deal of a sissy. Victoria Melita
is a spit-fire, very good-looking and anxious to let people
know about it. She rides horseback and fences to show
off her figure, and someone called her a Centaur.</p>

<p>"Be in the palace gardens tomorrow at eleven," answered
Melita, "and you will be convinced that I am not
half-horse, even if my husband is a ninny."</p>

<p>She kept the <i>rendezvous</i>, attired in a single garment of
diaphanous texture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>When Prince George heard that she had a lover, he
went to Darmstadt to "correct her," as he expressed himself
with much self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>But Victoria Melita proved to him that English princesses
are made of sterner stuff than the German variety.</p>

<p>"I will have none of your meddling," said the bride
of two years.</p>

<p>"I came here to make peace between you people."</p>

<p>"Play the dove to your daughter-in-law," quoth the
Grand-duchess. "I hear you are fighting like Kilkenny
cats."</p>

<p>"You are impertinent, Madame," cried George furiously.</p>

<p>"You will oblige me by showing this man the door,"
demanded Victoria Melita, addressing her husband.</p>

<p>"Not until I have explained the situation," answered
Ernest Ludwig quietly. "Listen, then, cousin! While I
am by principle opposed to divorce, I won't force my wife
to live with me."</p>

<p>"And now be so kind as to withdraw," said Victoria
Melita, opening the door for Prince George. Poor as I
am, I would have given five thousand marks to have seen
the meddling pest exit in that fashion, and I love Victoria
Melita for the spirit she displayed, even if I don't approve
of her <i>liaisons</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>February 10, 1896</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>A mighty virtuous remark escaped me on the last
page, and I almost feel like asking the Grand-duchess's
pardon, for, whatever I am, I'm no hypocrite. Melita is
said to have a lover; I have an admirer. Up to now I
don't care a rap for him, but who knows?</p>

<p>It's Count Bielsk of the Roumanian Embassy. I can't
remember whether he was ever introduced to me. Most
probably he was, but I forgot.</p>

<p>An elegant fellow&mdash;always looks as if he stepped out
of a tailor's shop in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>Every single night I go to the theatre the Count occupies
an orchestra chair that affords the best possible view
of the royal box. It happened too often and too persistently
to be accidental. Moreover, I observe that he pays
no attention to the play. He has eyes for me only.</p>

<p>Impertinence? Decidedly, but I can't be angry with
the fellow. On the contrary, I am flattered, and the kind
face and the fine eyes he's got!</p>

<p>Poor stupid Tisch doesn't approve of the theatre, of
course, and usually begs to be excused on the plea of religious
duties. "What a sinner you must be," I sometimes
say, "when you are obliged to forever bother God with
prayers."</p>

<p>The Schoenberg I send into the next box, for she is no
spy and never watches me. But if I must take Tisch, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
always command her to sit behind me. Etiquette forbids
her the front of the box and from the rear she can see
only the stage.</p>

<p>What fun to carry on a flirtation right under the nose
of that acrid-hearted, snivelling bigot, who would mortgage
part of the eternal bliss she promises herself for a
chance to catch me at it!</p>

<p>Am I flirting, then?</p>

<p>To spite the Tisch I would plant horns on the very
Kaiser.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p style="margin-left: 44em;"><i>April 1, 1896.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The Duke of Saxony is dead&mdash;the man who at one
time offered violence to His Majesty. Bernhardt was mistaken;
he left a wife and three children. Of course, no
recognized wife. Just the woman he married. Unless you
are of the blood-royal, you won't see the difference, but
that is no concern of mine.</p>

<p>Novels and story books have a good deal to say on
the subject of inheritance-fights among the lowly. Greed,
hard-heartedness, close-fistedness, treachery, cheating all
around! See what will happen to the Duke's widow and
her little ones.</p>

<p>According to the house laws, a regular pirate's code,
his late Highness's fortune reverts to the family treasury.
Prince Johann George will derive the revenues from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
real estate the Duke owned privately. He is already rich,&mdash;sufficient
reason for his wanting more. I shudder when
I think what they will do to the woman the Duke married.</p>

<p>The most notable thing about the funeral was the
"calling down" Prince Bernhardt got.</p>

<p>"You will go to my valet and ask him to lend you one
of my helmets. Yours is not the regulation form, I see,"
said the King to him in the voice of a drill-sergeant. And
Bernhardt had to take to his heels like a school-boy caught
stealing apples.</p>

<p>I had to laugh when I observed the meeting between
my erstwhile admirer, the Prince of Bulgaria, and His
Majesty.</p>

<p>Ferdinand's broad chest was ablaze with orders and
decorations, but his valet had forgotten to pin onto him
the Cross of the <i>Rautenkrone</i>, the Royal Saxe House decoration.
There were plenty of others, but the King had eyes
only for the one not dangling from a green ribbon. Consequently,
Ferdinand, though a sovereign Prince, got only
one "<i>How art thou?</i>" If we were living in the eighteenth,
instead of the nineteenth, century, his valet's neglect would
constitute a prime cause for war between the two countries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<h4>MELITA'S LOVE AFFAIRS AND MINE</h4>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>April 15, 1896</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Melita conducted herself at the funeral and in our
palace as unconcernedly as if she and George were fast
friends. She smiled every time she saw him, and he cut
her dead to his heart's content. During the three days'
stay of the Hesses, I had many a good talk and many a
good laugh with Melita, and now I got a true and unabridged
record of what happened at Darmstadt during
George's meddling visit there.</p>

<p>The Grand-duchess, who can be as catty as they make
'em, had her secretary sit behind a screen to take stenographic
notes.</p>

<p>Saxon kings and princes always roar and bellow when,
in conversation or otherwise, things go against their "all-highest"
grain. As soon as George felt that he was losing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
ground, he began to bark and yell, whereupon Melita interrupted
him by saying, "I beg you to take notice that you
are in <i>my</i> house."</p>

<p>George grew so red in the face, Melita hoped for an
apoplectic fit. But after a few seconds he managed to
blurt out: "It's your husband's house."</p>

<p>"While I am Grand-duchess of Hesse it's my house,
too. Moreover, this is my room and I forbid you to play
the ruffian here."</p>

<p>Prince George looked at the Grand-duke, but Ernest
Ludwig said nothing.</p>

<p>"I am here as the King's representative. I represent
the chief of the Royal House of Saxony."</p>

<p>"A fig for your Royal House of Saxony," said Melita,
snapping her fingers in George's face. "Queen Victoria is
my chief of family, and, that aside, Ludwig and I are sovereigns
in Hesse and have no intention whatever to allow
anyone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Anyone?" repeated George aghast. "You refer to me
as anyone?"</p>

<p>"In things matrimonial," said Melita, "only husband
and wife count; all others are 'anyone.' You, too."</p>

<p>"She calls me 'you,'" cried George, white with rage,
looking helplessly at Ernest Ludwig. When the latter kept
his tongue and temper, George addressed himself to Melita
once more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"I want you to understand that my title is Royal
Highness."</p>

<p>"And I want you to understand that I am Her Royal
Highness the Grand-duchess of Hesse, Royal Princess of
Great Britain and Ireland, Duchess of Saxony," cried Melita,
stamping her foot.</p>

<p>With that she went to the door, opened it and said,
"I request Your Royal Highness to leave my house this
very second."</p>

<p>And George went.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>June 1, 1896</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Poor virtuous me, to chide myself, and call myself
names for flirting with Count Bielsk&mdash;at a distance of
twenty feet or more! "I could kick my back," as the Duc
de Richelieu&mdash;not the Cardinal, but the lover of the Regent's
daughters and "every wife's husband"&mdash;used to say (only
a bit more grossly) when I think what I miss in this dead-alive
Dresden.</p>

<p>Darmstadt isn't half as big a town, and the Hesse
establishment doesn't compare with ours in magnitude, but
what fun Melita is having!</p>

<p>Of course, it isn't <i>all</i> fun, for her husband is a "sexless"
thing, and, like the Grand-duchess Serge of Russia, she
would be a virgin, though married for years, if it wasn't
for the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"The other" is none other but Kyril, the lover of our
Dolores,&mdash;Kyril isn't exactly pining away when separated
from Melita.</p>

<p>Well, Melita wants him all to herself. She wants a
divorce. The complacent husband, who is no husband at
all, doesn't suit her. Exit Ernest Ludwig&mdash;officially. Enter
Kyril&mdash;legitimately.</p>

<p>She made me reams of confidences, indulged in whole
<i>brochures</i> of dissertations on the question of sex. What
an ignoramus I am! I didn't understand half she said and
was ashamed to ask.</p>

<p>Ernest Ludwig is the most accommodating of husbands.
Knows all about Kyril and would gladly shut both
eyes if they let him. Melita might, if pressed very hard,
for adultery has no terrors for her, but Kyril affects the
idealist. Sure sign that he really loves her. If he was
mine, I would be afraid of this Kyril. No doubt he is
jealous as a Turk.</p>

<p>Last week the three of them had a conference. Lovely
to see husband, wife and paramour "in peaceful meeting
assembled" and talk over the situation as if it concerned
the Royal stud or something of the sort.</p>

<p>No recriminations, no threats, no heroics; only when
Ernest Ludwig submitted that divorce be avoided to save
his face as a sovereign, Kyril got a bit excited.</p>

<p>"This is not a question of politics," he said, "or what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
the dear public thinks. Your wife don't want you; as a
matter of fact, she isn't your wife, and since we are in
love with each other, we ought to marry."</p>

<p>"Marry, marry, why always marry?" demanded the
Grand-duke. "I acknowledge that I haven't the right to
interfere in my wife's pleasure&mdash;I am not built that way.
Well, I <i>don't</i> interfere. What more do you want? You
don't deny that I am the chief person to be considered."</p>

<p>"You?" mocked Kyril. "You with your sovereignty
are not in it at all. If it wasn't for you, Melita and I
could marry and say no more about it."</p>

<p>"But I don't prevent your enjoyment of each other,"
pleaded the ruler of the Hessians.</p>

<p>Now the idealistic Kyril got on his high horse. "Grand-duke,"
he said, "if you don't object to your wife having a
lover, that's your business. For my part, I object to my
paramour having a husband."</p>

<p>And so on <i>ad infinitum</i>, and a goose like me abuses
herself for a bit of goo-goo-eyeing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>They are treating me like a laying hen. Expect another
golden egg in December. Hence, "closed season"
for imperious commands, "all-highest" orders and petty
meannesses.</p>

<p>When I learned that Bernhardt was in Dresden, I
phoned him to come out and see me&mdash;without asking either
royal, princely, or the Tisch's permission.</p>

<p>A junior prince, without fortune or high protector, is
really to be pitied. His title, the vague possibility that
some day he may be called to the throne, stand between
him and enjoyment of life as a man. Nothing left, but to
enjoy himself like a pig.</p>

<p>Bernhardt admits it. "They planted me in the God-forsakenest
hole in the kingdom. If I saw a pretty woman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in my garrison from one year's end to the other, I would
die of joy. And the newspaper scribblers wonder why we
are all Oscar Wildes.</p>

<p>"Just to kill time, I am learning the carpenter's trade&mdash;this
Royal Highness, you must know, lives in a carpenter's
house, as innocent of sanitary arrangements as a
Bushman's hut. Of course, I run away every little while
to Dresden, incog. to pay my respects to Venus.</p>

<p>"Louise," he cried with comic emphasis, "may the three
hours you steal from my girl, by way of this visit, be deducted
from your eternal beatitude."</p>

<p>I lent the poor fellow five hundred marks and he rushed
back to Dresden.</p>

<p>Tonight I told Frederick Augustus of my interview
with Bernhardt, not mentioning the five hundred, of course.</p>

<p>He laughed. "He's no worse than the rest of us used
to be," he said. "I did exactly like him, and father and
uncle and brothers and cousins, ditto. Behold&mdash;your
husband-locksmith! Max spent all his time reading
the Lives of the Popes. That made him the dried-up
mummy he is. But, believe me, I gave the girls many
a treat. All the money I could beg, borrow or steal went
for girls."</p>

<p>Which explains Frederick Augustus's bedroom manners&mdash;sometime
transplanted to the parlor.</p>

</p>

<p>I gave Saxony a third prince on December 9, and really
I wasn't quite in condition to be scolded at today's family
dinner. But since, with three boys growing up, the succession
is more than guaranteed, the season for insults is
again open.</p>

<p>His Majesty, our most gracious, sublime, etc., sovereign,
sulks. Consequently the family looks glum, down
in the mouth, utterly unhappy.</p>

<p>Max gets up to make a speech and one could fairly
see the lies wriggle out of his mouth full of defective teeth:
exemplary family life; traditional friendship of all members
for each other; perfect unity; the King and all
the princes brave as lions; the Queen and all the princesses
paragons of virtue. And the fatherly love with which the
King embraces us all; his more than royal generosity; his
mildness, his Christian virtues!</p>

<p>The Queen is a goose. Max's lying commonplaces
make her forget her many years of misery spent at this
court, and she grows as sentimental as a kitten. Fat Mathilda,
Isabelle and Johann George applaud Max despite
their better understanding, and now the King rises to make
his usual New Year's address.</p>

<p>The gist of his long-winded remarks is this: "I am
the lord, your master, and I will see to it that you&mdash;wife,
brother, nephews and nieces&mdash;will dance as I whistle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>"For obedience to the King is the highest law," he paraphrases
Wilhelm,&mdash;"strictest, unconditional obedience" (and
he gave me a poisoned look) "and let no one forget it, no
one." With that he beat the table with his clenched fist, and
the whole assemblage turns an accusing eye on me.</p>

<p>They have driven the late Duke of Saxony's wife and
children from house and home&mdash;put her on the high-road,
piling her personal belongings, trunks, wardrobe and knick-knacks
outside, too.</p>

<p>She arrived in Dresden and sought refuge with her
widowed mother. Her father, a Court-Councillor, dismissed
because of the relations between the Duke and his daughter,
died of grief and mortification, almost penniless. And
the Ducal widow is as poor as the mother&mdash;and three children
to bring up! Children of the royal blood of Saxony,
children sanctioned by the Church of which they prate so
much, for there is no doubt that the pair married in
secret.</p>

<p>The late Highness kept all his papers in a strong-box,
and it's said the King's representative, who searched the
safe by Royal orders, found neither acknowledgment of
the marriage, nor a last will in favor of the widow and
children. Hence, all the Duke's belongings revert to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
royal family, and the estate he lived on goes to his next
of kin, Johann George.</p>

<p>Johann George, who has more money than he knows
what to do with, promptly sent the bailiff after his cousin's
wife and children.</p>

<p>"<i>Noblesse oblige</i>,&mdash;the way you interpret the old saying,
will advance the cause of monarchy immensely," I said to
the official heir.</p>

<p>"Is it any business of mine to support my relatives'
mistresses?" I saw he was mad clean through.</p>

<p>"You know very well that she was his wife."</p>

<p>"There is apparently no official record of the marriage."</p>

<p>"Maybe not in Dresden, as the nuptials were solemnized
abroad. But what about the testament?"</p>

<p>Johann George grew very red in the face. "If there
is one, the King must have confiscated it. That often happens
in royal houses."</p>

<p>"And you mean to say that, with all your riches, you
are heartless enough and contemptible enough&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take a care, Your Imperial Highness. The Duke's
strumpet was today indicted for <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</i> in connection
with the testament matter." This junior prince dared to
speak thus to me, the Crown Princess.</p>

<p>"Johann George," I cried, "forget not that sooner or
later I will be at the head of the royal family of Saxony.
I forbid you to introduce your mess-room jargon into my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
parlor; at the same time I am sincerely sorry that a Prince
of Saxony should stoop to buy cigarettes and gasoline with
the pittance stolen from his cousin's widow and her three
little children."</p>

<p>I went to the door and told the lackey on duty to fetch
his Royal Highness's carriage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>The talk with Johann George had excited me so, I
wanted a diversion. Frederick Augustus sent word that he
wouldn't be home for dinner. Hence, I decided to go to
the theatre after an absence of months. It was after six
when I telephoned that I would occupy my box at the
Royal Opera. If I should see Him there, in the absence
of announcements in the newspapers!</p>

<p>He was there. In his usual seat. I won't rest until
I find out how he manages to get wind of my theatrical
ventures at such short notice. The Opera, Faust, had been
in progress for ten minutes when I arrived. I espied him
at once, but kept well behind the curtains of the box for a
second or two. Then, suddenly, I dropped into the gilded
armchair and the very same moment our eyes met.</p>

<p>I am sure he expected me; he must have known I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
near when I entered the house. To his ears the hundred
and one melodies of Gounod's masterpiece were naught
compared with the music of my silken skirts.</p>

<p>He was so overcome, he forgot his diplomacy. Twice
he pressed his right hand to his heart, then bowed his head
in a mute salute.</p>

<p>Fortunately the house was dark at the time and the
audience, unacquainted with my visit, paid strict attention
to the stage. No one but him saw my heart leap
within me and the blood mount to my cheeks. Presently
his diplomatic tact got the upper hand again, and he fixed
his eyes on the score. That afforded me the chance to
take a pictorial inventory of my lover-at-a-distance. I used
my opera-glasses unmercifully.</p>

<p>He's a fine looking man&mdash;if he were a woman he would
be hailed a beauty. His forehead is a dream of loveliness;
his mouth a promise of a thousand sweet kisses.</p>

<p>If this man wants me, I mean if he wants me badly,
our love won't be any painted business, I assure you.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Dresden</span>, <i>April 26, 1897, Night</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>We went to the ball as His Majesty's representatives,
Frederick Augustus and I, and were obliged to say a few
nothingnesses to a hundred paltry persons or more. When
the Ambassador introduced Count Bielsk, I said in the most
careless voice of the world, "I hear you love the theatre,
Count."</p>

<p>"I don't care a rap for the theatre," he replied. "I
go to opera and operetta simply to see you, Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>Such audacity! And he spoke quite loud.</p>

<p>Frightened, I turned to the next person presented, saying
something imbecile, no doubt.</p>

<p>Later I withdrew upon the dais to watch the dancing,
and at a moment when I was quite alone, he came up to
me, making it appear as if I had commanded his attendance.</p>

<p>"I have much to say to Your Imperial Highness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>I didn't have my wits about me and didn't know how
to act. He repeated twice or oftener: "Pray, Your Imperial
Highness, I have something to say to you," until, at
last, I threw etiquette to the winds and asked:</p>

<p>"Why should you wish to talk to me in private, Count?"
No royal woman indulging in lovers ever encouraged a
rogue more carelessly.</p>

<p>"Because my life and happiness depend on what I have
to say to you."</p>

<p>And, weaker still, I assented by the tone of my voice
rather than words: "You make me curious, Count. Whatever
you have to say, say it now."</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to me, with a soul and reputation-destroying
look. "Thanks!" Then wildly, clamorously:
"Louise, I love you."</p>

<p>Instinctively I thought of flight, but his eyes wouldn't
let me rise. From that moment on he dropped my title.</p>

<p>"Stay," he whispered, "I beseech you, stay. Don't
you see that I love you to distraction? I have kept silent
these many months. Now I must talk. I love thee,
Louise."</p>

<p>I tried in vain to collect my thoughts while his love talk
fanned my blood. Finally I managed to say: "Can't you
see that you are playing <i>va banque</i>?"</p>

<p>"I know, but it doesn't interest me. Let my career
be wrecked, I care not; I've got only one thought in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
world&mdash;thee, only one wish&mdash;thee. And I must either love
thee or die."</p>

<p>I turned my eyes away and rose abruptly. As he bowed
to kiss my hand, he whispered, still "<i>thou'ing</i>" me: "I expect
you tomorrow at the end of the Grand Boulevard.
Come when you please. I will wait all day."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And here I am thinking, thinking, thinking.</p>

<p>"The end of the Boulevard" is the beginning of Dresden's
<i>Bois</i>. Does this madman really suppose that Her
Imperial Highness, the Crown Princess of this kingdom,
will lower herself and respond to his demand for a rendezvous?</p>

<p>Yet, how he must love me to risk saying what he did
say to me. He is no ill-balanced youth; he is a man of
ripe judgment. His passion got the better of him.</p>

<p>I adore passion.</p>

<p>I must go no more to the theatre. Impossible for me
to see him nightly.</p>

<p>But it's a fine thing to be loved as I am. The most
beautiful thing in the wide, wide world!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 32em;">Dresden</span>, <i>April 27, 1897. In the Morning.</i><br />
</p>

<p>He is waiting. Doubtless he expects me. What a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
persuasive thing love is, to be sure! Because he loves me,
he argues that the Crown Princess, the wife and mother,
will rush to meet him, fall into his arms.</p>

<p>Of course, he will be most unhappy if I don't go, for
I am sure he is not your ordinary "petticoat-chaser." He
will suffer, he is suffering now while I sit here quietly.</p>

<p>Am I quiet? If I weren't determined to stay at home,
I would half-admit to myself that my soul is obsessed with
longing for this man.</p>

<p>A diplomat, who has seen much of court life, assumes
that a woman in my position is at liberty to keep rendezvous!
Let's reason it out.</p>

<p>To begin with, Lucretia has to be won over. That's
easy enough, but the coachman and lackey! They must be
told that Her Imperial Highness is graciously pleased to
<i>walk</i> in the <i>Bois</i>, the carriage waiting at the end of the
Grand Boulevard.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 40em;"><i>After Luncheon.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>I ought to have said to him, I won't come. It's cruel
to let him wait on a street corner and not even send notice,
and to tip him off is impossible.</p>

<p>And come to think of it, if Lucretia and I were promenading
in the <i>Bois</i> and met the Count by accident, where's
the harm? And if I don't go&mdash;Good Lord, he might kill<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
himself. He is desperate enough for that. And he might
leave letters compromising me.</p>

<p>I will go to give him a piece of my mind. I will be
very harsh with him, very adamant.</p>

<p>And I will try to find out how he manages to select
always the same theatre as I.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>June 1, 1897.</i><br />
</p>

<p>A month of untold happiness. I went to the <i>Bois</i> and
I am going there every afternoon.</p>

<p>He was splendid; he was modest, quiet. He seemed
to exude happiness.</p>

<p>Lucretia is discretion itself. She kept behind us, but
out of ear-shot.</p>

<p>"I came to tell you that you acted like a madman last
night, and that the offense must not be repeated," I said
sternly to Bielsk.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> a madman&mdash;in love," he replied, looking at me
with big, soulful eyes.</p>

<p>I chattered a lot of nonsense, prohibitions, commands,
entreaties.</p>

<p>"Remove thy glove," he begged.</p>

<p>"You mustn't 'thou' me."</p>

<p>"Remove thy glove," he repeated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Why I complied, I don't know, but I ripped off my
glove, and he held my hand in both his hands and kissed
it and kissed it.</p>

<p>"What right have you got to treat me like a woman
unmindful of her duties?"</p>

<p>"I know that thou art lonesome, forlorn, Louise."</p>

<p>He struck at my heart as he spoke these words, and
my eyes filled with tears. He pressed his warm, pulsating
lips on the palm of my hand, covering it from wrist to
finger-tips with wild kisses.</p>

<p>We were standing among the trees, and Lucretia, at a
little distance, was plucking flowers. The remnant of common
sense I mustered told me: "He is dishonoring you,
repulse him," but his "I love thee, Louise," rang like
music in my ears. However, I tore myself free at last.
"Farewell, we must never meet again."</p>

<p>And then I lay in his arms, on his broad chest, and
he covered my face with kisses, not passionate or insulting
kisses. His lips touched lightly my eyes, my cheeks, my
own lips&mdash;recompense for the long fast he had endured
during all the months he had loved me at a distance.</p>

<p>Marvelous kisses kissed this man, pure kisses, lovely
kisses, powerful kisses. And I thought the whole world was
falling to pieces around me and I didn't care as long as
only he and I were living. He himself freed me.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow," he whispered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>I awoke confused, ashamed of my weakness, trembling.</p>

<p>"I'll never see you again. Never," I said as if I
meant it.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow, love," he repeated. And I ran and joined
Lucretia.</p>

<p>When we were riding home I told Lucretia to draw the
curtains, and fell upon her neck and told her all.</p>

<p>The good soul was nearly frightened to death and we
cried a good deal.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>January 5, 1898</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I neglected my diary, I neglect everything, for I'm in
love. What care I for the King, Prince George and the
rest who are trying to make life miserable for me? I
laugh their pettinesses to scorn, for I have no other thought
now but Romano Bielsk, no other interests. He is my all,
my happiness.</p>

<p>Of course, his "<i>Tomorrow, love</i>," prevailed and it has
been "<i>Tomorrow, love</i>," ever since. On the day after our
first meeting I actually thought I was warring against nature
if I resisted his entreaties. It seemed to me that I
had always known him, that we were predestined for each
other. I still think so.</p>

<p>Lucretia has a relative here, an aunt, member of the
court set. Old Countess Baranello delights in intrigue and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
hates Prince George. When I told her of my affair, she
placed her palace at our disposal, saying:</p>

<p>"Bielsk shall have a key to the garden gate and to the
pavilion inside the walls, which connects, through a subterranean
passage, with my sun-parlor. You can meet your
love there any time. I will see to it that none of the servants
or workmen disturb you."</p>

<p>A capital arrangement, worthy of an old lady who has
seen many gallant days! There can be no possible objection
to my visits at her palace, and the grounds to which
Romano has the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> fronts on a street unfrequented by
society or carriages.</p>

<p>I descend from my carriage at the palace gate; a knot
of people, a small crowd, perhaps, collects to salute me and
gape at the horses and livery. I sweep up the stoop, lined
by my own, and the Countess's, servants. The bronze doors
open. The Countess advances with stately curtsy; a few
words <i>sub rosa</i>, and I&mdash;fly into the arms of love, while
faithful Lucretia mounts guard at the street side, and Her
Ladyship's spy glasses cover the garden;&mdash;needless precautions,
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It's rare fun, and, after all, where's the harm?</p>

<p>I made good as propagatrix of the royal race, and a
union of soul such as exists between me and Romano never
entered into my relations with Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>Romano is very intelligent. I can learn from him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Frederick Augustus taught me only coarseness, and if it
came high, <i>double entendres</i>. Yet my lover is only a Councillor
of Legation! Because his superiors, fearing his
adroitness, keep him down.</p>

<p>My children! Have I ever been allowed to be a real
mother to them? The King, the nation, owns my little
ones. I see them at stated intervals for half an hour or so,
and romp with them as I do with my dogs.</p>

<p>Still, I don't altogether approve of Louise, malicious
girl! When I am at the top-gallant of my happiness I
sometimes say to myself: "Oh, if only George could see
me now!"</p>

<p>Naughty Louise&mdash;it's unworthy of thee. What do I
care for George, what do I care for the world?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>May 20, 1898</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Romano learned about my theatre going by a diplomatic
trick. He told one of the minor attaches of the Embassy
that he had orders to watch me&mdash;"all-highest command."
The official, consequently, negotiated with the box offices
of all the theatres to phone him the moment Her Imperial
Highness ordered seats.</p>

<p>I am crazy to know how many women Romano loved
in the twenty or more years since he grew to man's estate,
and how many he seduced. It agitates and pains me to
think of it, but all my questions are barren of results.</p>

<p>Yesterday I asked him whether he ever knew a Princess
of the Blood before me&mdash;"knew" in the biblical sense.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>"In love," he said, "there are no princesses, there are
women only."</p>

<p>He saw that I was hurt and added quickly: "Now
don't be unreasonable, Louise&mdash;no prejudices. With the
thought in my mind that you are an Imperial Highness, or
that you consider yourself of better clay than I, I couldn't
love you as I do."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>July 1, 1898</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>We made a life-pact. Romano cut a gold piece in two
and bored a hole in each half. He drew thin gold chains
through the holes, gave me one of the amulets, and
kept the other. Our combined monograms were already
engraved on the bits of gold <i>en miniature</i>. Each swore to
wear the talisman on the naked body for life, but we exchange
amulets daily, or as often as we meet.</p>

<p>When I am enthroned in the royal box and look down
upon my lover below, I think all the time of this, our secret
understanding, and it sometimes occurs to me, that the
opera house might get on fire and both of us perish.</p>

<p>Next day our bodies would be found. In or near the
royal box, that of a woman, burned so as to be unrecognizable
at first. ("We are all of the same clay," says Romano.)</p>

<p>And down in the orchestra floor they would find Romano's
body, likewise unrecognizable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>And on my charred breast they would find the half of
a twenty-mark piece. And on his charred chest they would
find the half of a twenty-mark piece.</p>

<p>And they would put the two together and discover
that they match.</p>

<p>Consternation, speculation!</p>

<p>Someone suggests that the mysterious gold pieces be
photographed for publication and the engraver who made
the monogram, and the jeweler who sold the two chains
come forward as witnesses.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the identity of my body is established. That
of Romano's follows. <i>Scandalum magnatum!</i> But what
are you going to do about it, <i>Messieurs</i>?</p>

<p>If you had only known it a week ago! A prison <i>&agrave; la</i>
Princess Ahlden, or the Danish Queen Caroline Matilda,
for me, disgraceful dismissal for Romano, for times are
happily past when comely gentlemen, who have the wit
to amuse royal ladies, durst be murdered in cold blood
like Koenigsmarck, or be-handed, be-headed and cut into
ninety-nine pieces as Struensee was in Copenhagen market-square.</p>

<p>What are you going to do about it, King, George,
Frederick Augustus?</p>

<p>I'll tell you. You will bury me with the pomp of
kings; and your sycophants will print beautiful stories about
me, asserting that I died trying to rescue others, or did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
something of the sort; and your Court Chaplains will weep
and pray and lie for me. And the tip of Queen Carola's

</p>

<p>My young friend Bernhardt is doing me a great service
and himself a lot of harm.</p>

<p>A good-natured, tractable boy <i>au fond</i>, they made him
a poltroon and worse by their persecutions, their meanness,
their petty tyranny. He is proud, and they sent him to
reside on a village manure heap; he is ambitious, and must
drill raw recruits from morn till night; he is eager to learn
and they try to embalm his intellect with tracts and kill
his initiative by the endless, watery <i>ennui</i> of tu-penny
environment.</p>

<p>Of course, he gets desperate and kicks over the traces,
and while attracting the dear family's disapproving attention,
I am more free than ever to devote myself to my
Romano.</p>

<p>Bernhardt's "latest" is really inexcusable. "I wonder
we don't turn tigers with the education we receive," said
one of the brothers of Louis XVI when upbraided for
thoughtlessness and lack of consideration for the feelings
of others&mdash;but Bernhardt seems to qualify for a vulture, and
no original one at that, for a like offense as he is charged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
with was, several years ago, laid at the door of my cousin,
Archduke Otho of Austria.</p>

<p>Observe half a dozen young officers riding horseback
in the neighborhood of their garrison town, Bernhardt at
the head. At a bend in the road, a rural funeral <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>
hoves into sight: coffin borne on the shoulders of half a
dozen peasants; weeping relatives; friends promising themselves
a good time at the widow's expense on returning
home. A black cross lifted high; priest and choir-boys in
their robes.</p>

<p>"Halt," thunders Bernhardt, blocking the way.</p>

<p>The priest tries to expostulate with the half-drunken
fellow.</p>

<p>"Shut up, black-coat. I am His Royal Highness, Prince
Bernhardt."</p>

<p>Then&mdash;the devil must be riding him&mdash;he orders the
coffin put down on the ground.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, yokels."</p>

<p>And he leaps his horse three or four times across the
coffin.</p>

<p>The outrage is duly reported in the newspapers and
Bernhardt is summoned before the King. "Don't you dare
to appear in uniform," Albert added in his own hand.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" I asked the ne'er-do-well, when
he begged for an audience after meeting the King.</p>

<p>He pointed to a swollen cheek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"He hit me three times in <i>the eats</i>." (I beg the Diary's
pardon for the language; I report literally.) "Three
times," repeated Bernhardt, "that's the reason he wanted me
to appear in mufti. As I went out one of the lackeys said:
'I never heard His Majesty rave so.'"</p>

<p>"But why did you make a beast of yourself?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To force the King to transfer me to another garrison,
of course. I can't remain where I am, for the people
are terribly incensed against me."</p>

<p>"Did you tell His Majesty?"</p>

<p>"Not on your life," answered Bernhardt. "If I did,
I would have to stay there until my last tooth falls out. As
things are, the Colonel will insist upon my speedy transference,
and that's worth the three slams on the face I got
in addition to the various <i>Lausbubs</i>."</p>

<p>"He called you, an army officer, a '<i>Lausbub</i>.' Where is
his vaunted respect for the uniform?"</p>

<p>"Didn't he hit me in <i>the eats</i>?" lamented Bernhardt
tragically in his terrible lingo. "I responded both to insult
and injury by knocking my heels together and saying:
'At Your Majesty's commands.'"</p>

<p>Of course, I told Romano. "Royalty," he said, "has
only, on the face of it, advanced beyond the pirate and
robber-baron period. <i>Au fond</i> all princes and kings would
be criminals if they happened not to be crowned heads."</p>

<p>He told me of a Balkan prince&mdash;young Alexander of
Servia, the same mamma Natalie intended for my consort&mdash;whose
chief amusement consists in having mice and
rats chased by ferocious tom-cats in a big cage made for
that purpose. Once, growing tired of that sport, he incarcerated
ten tom-cats in the same cage without food many
days in succession, visiting the prison hourly to see whether
they wouldn't take to devouring each other.</p>

<p>When, in the end, they did, tearing one another to
pieces, His Majesty danced around the cage in high glee,
pronouncing the battle of the poor beasts a bully spectacle.</p>

<p>"You visited Castle Sibyllenort a week ago," continued
Romano&mdash;"a most proper place, this royal residence, is it
not? You ought to have seen it before your puritan King
inherited it, ten years ago, upon the death of the last Duke
of Brunswick. At that time it was a veritable museum
of pornography, the apotheosis of Paphian voluptuousness.
The palace, which has over four hundred rooms and halls&mdash;not
one which a decent woman might enter without a
blush&mdash;acquired its equipment as a <i>lupanar</i> and its reputation
for debauchery under the famous, or notorious, 'Diamond
Duke,' a brother of the Highness who left the estate
to King Albert. Both Dukes held high carnival in its gilded
halls, but he of the diamonds rather outdid William in outraging
decency.</p>

<p>"One of his chief amusements was to hire a drove of
ballet girls for parlor horses. He had a carriage con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>structed
no bigger or heavier than a Japanese jinrickshaw,
and to this hitched ten or twenty ballet girls in their birthday
suits, walking on all fours, himself rider and driver.</p>

<p>"Gracious&mdash;how he lashed his treble and quadruple
teams of human flesh as they pulled him from room to
room, and his was no make-belief ferocity, either. He was
a niggardly rake, but in order to indulge his Sadist tendencies,
agreed to pay one <i>Thaler</i> (Seventy-five cents) for
every drop of blood shed by the girls.</p>

<p>"To make the count easier, white linen sheets were
spread over the carpets, and the sum total was paid over
to the two-legged horses after each entertainment, the girls
showing the sorest stripes or wounds getting the larger
share."</p>

<p>Romano, who lived at half a dozen courts and is primed
with the scandalous gossip of them all, could certainly write
an entertaining book on the fallacies and vices of the
world's Great.</p>

<p>It's most indelicate, to be sure, but I laughed long and
hard over the sexual specialty of my uncle, Archduke Karl
Ludwig, who is bad, anyhow, as everybody knows.</p>

<p>One morning His Highness rose at an unusually early
hour, even before the scrub-women made their exit. In
the corridors, in the parlors, everywhere blonde and dark
percherons, cleaning away for dear life and courting housemaid's
knee!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>Karl Ludwig has no more use for women than the
late Chevalier de Lorraine, the President of the <i>Mignons</i>,
but the exaggerated protuberances he met so unexpectedly
on all sides, appealed to his sense of humor, or some other
sense which I would hate to name. Anyhow, he ran into
the garden and cut himself a switch. And ever since then
his chief amusement is to switch scrubbing percherons. If
he succeeds in dealing one a blow unforeseen by lying in
wait for her, or coming upon her all of a sudden, he is
particularly satisfied with his day's work and is liable to
give a beggar a copper instead of the usual demi-copper.</p>

<p>And of such abnormals the rulers of the world are
recruited.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>Christmas, 1898</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>God punished me for my sins. My children, one after
the other, were ill with scarlet fever, and the youngest is
only now out of danger. Of course, I abandoned all my
frivolities. I can say without boasting that the mother
atoned for the short-comings of the wife and princess.</p>

<p>Hence I thought justified to arrange for a right royal
Christmas present: Romano.</p>

<p>Lucretia went to see him. He received her coldly,
hardly vouchsafed a word. From a secret drawer of his
desk he took a letter, ready written, dated and gave it to
Lucretia. "It explains," he said curtly, as he opened the
door for her.</p>

<p>He has abandoned me. Because I loved my children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
better than him, because I am a mother first, Lais second,
he throws away his Imperial <i>fille de joie</i> like a lemon sucked
dry and prates of tendernesses and heavenly fancies that he
alone feels, that are outside the pale of my understanding.</p>

<p>He even refuses to thank me, this proud wooer of the
royal bed. He "has given me the best that is in man to
give to a woman," etc., etc.</p>

<p>Be it so! God desired to punish me and, because I
loved much, he meted out to me mild chastisement.</p>

<p>He stole my lover, but I have my children.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>January 15, 1899</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The King, Prince George, my brothers-in-law, my
cousins and aunts are trying to make a hero of me. Because
I followed the inclinations of my heart and helped
to save my children, there's no end of their praise and
admiration. Did they take me for a raven? I am disgusted
with so much unctuousness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless I changed my mind about the Duke's
widow. When I felt friendly towards her and quarrelled
with Johann George for taking her money and with the
King for embezzling the testament and offering accommodation
at the poor-house for his kin's children, I thought it
a family affair, but now that the Socialist papers meddle
with the case, which concerns the royal house and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
royal house alone, it's time for the Crown Princess to stand
by her colors.</p>

<p>Those Jews have actually the audacity to reprimand
the King and the royal princes, to impute ignoble motives
to us all! They talk of us as if we were <i>Messieurs</i> and
<i>Mesdames</i> Jones or Browns, trying to enrich ourselves at
the expense of a corpse!</p>

<p>They call us "inheritance-chasers," "purloiners of pupillary
funds," "starvers of innocent children."</p>

<p>The Duke's kept-woman is "a lady of the highest character"
and we are not; her children are of the blood royal&mdash;only
better for the dash of plebeian.</p>

<p>It makes me boil to read such things; to see the reverence
due the throne set aside, the royal banner dragged
into the mire, and of course it's the kept-woman to whom
we are indebted for this pretty kettle of fish. It is she
who set the press against us, and it's me, Louise, who protests
with all her might that her demands and petitions be
denied.</p>

<p>Let her starve with her brats. If she was sent to the
poor-house she might make anarchists out of loyal paupers.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>April 1, 1899</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>My parents came to see the children and make merry
because I am basking in the sun of royal grace. Mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
has a new maid of honor, as ugly as the Tisch, and when
we are <i>entre nous</i> every second word is: "when Louise is
Queen." They know to a penny what our inheritance from
the King, the Queen and Prince George will amount to and
are forever making plans and specifications how to spend
the money for the glory of Saxony and of our own family.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Mother's scare-crow of a maid of honor had at least
sense enough to tell Lucretia of a few scandals that happened
at home, which mother never intended for my ears.</p>

<p>It seems that papa, some few months ago, suddenly
became possessed of the ambition to become an astronomer.
Nothing would do, but he must buy a heap of instruments
and set them up in a distant tower of Salzburg Castle.
And there he spent all his evenings&mdash;star-gazing, he gave
out.</p>

<p>He seldom reached the nuptial couch before one or two
in the morning,&mdash;utterly exhausted by the night's work.</p>

<p>Well, mamma thought he labored too hard, and one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
forenoon when he had gone hunting, climbed up many
stairs to investigate. Imagine her surprise when she found,
in the astrolatry, a young lady in the act of getting out
of bed, a girl, by the way, whom I used to know.</p>

<p>Mamma had the <i>mauvais genre</i> to report the case to
Emperor Francis Joseph, while papa sought another climate,
remaining away until mother begged him on her bended
knees, so to speak, to come home. Nor did she get satisfaction
from Vienna. That great moral teacher, the
Emperor, told her not to make a scare-crow of herself, but
on the contrary make herself pretty and agreeable for,
and to, her lord and master. I understand now why mamma
says: "All men stick together like gypsies."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact father's limited resources are considerably
affected by the various alimonies he has to pay to
his own mistresses and those of my brothers. The third
born of our boys, only a week ago, made too free with the
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> of the pastry-cook, who threatened to kill him. It
cost father several thousand florins to appease the ruffian
and Heinrich Ferdinand renewed acquaintance with mother's
boxing proclivities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<h4>A PLEBEIAN LOVER</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>In need of a friend&mdash;My physician offers his friendship&mdash;I discover
that he loves me, but he will never confess&mdash;I give
him encouragement&mdash;We manage to persuade the King to

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>in May, 1899</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Privy Councillor von Barthels, my body physician, is
a very agreeable man. I have no use for his services, <i>professional</i>
services at present, yet insist upon receiving him
daily. Still I love him not. Only esteem him as a friend,
I need a friend. Physicians can keep secrets, and I have
many of them. I look upon Barthels as my Father-confessor.</p>

<p>The tears came into his eyes when I told him, and he
said: "Imperial Highness, this is the most beautiful hour
of my life."</p>

<p>He spoke with enthusiasm; there was fire in his eyes
and in his voice, yet a moment later he was again the most
reserved of men and conversation lagged.</p>

<p>It happened three days ago. He has paid me four
visits since and I notice with astonishment, with curi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>osity
and with alarm, that this man is in love with me.</p>

<p>How long has he loved me?</p>

<p>His love is like a warm mantle 'round my shoulders
on a chilly night. It exudes warmth, strength, beatitude,
yet there is none of the animal.</p>

<p>He is a good talker on a thousand and one subjects,
a thinker and psychologist. Psychology is his strong point.
He argues brilliantly on the subject, yet I need only look
at him to upset his <i>thesis</i>, to make him stammer and redden.</p>

<p>He's no Count Bielsk and will never tell me of his
own accord that he loves me. Is his admiration greater
than his love? Perhaps so. It gives me a feeling of security.</p>

<p>Lucretia knows, but in the presence of the Tisch, he
plays the servant, deeming himself thrice honored by being
allowed to breathe the same air as her Imperial Highness.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>June 15, 1899</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I frequently drive to the <i>Bois</i> nowadays with the
children, the <i>Bois</i>, where I was so happy with Him.</p>

<p>Romano was right, a thousand times right, that he
abandoned me when our love was at its zenith.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 42em;"><i>At Midnight.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>It's done.</p>

<p>Barthels came tonight. He was so feverish, so passion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>ate,
there was so much humble solicitation in his looks and
manners, I was moved to pity.</p>

<p>This man is too over-awed by my rank to ever permit
himself to express his feelings by word of mouth. He
talked of everything but love and was in the midst of a
learned dissertation when I sunk my eyes in his and said:</p>

<p>"Why do you try to hide things from me? Don't I
know what's in your heart?"</p>

<p>Like a little criminal&mdash;as my oldest boy does occasionally&mdash;he
turned red, then white, then red again. He buried
his face in his hands. He trembled. He seemed to be
crying. I arose, and lightly laid my hand upon his blonde
head.</p>

<p>He's got the finest, silkiest hair in the world, shimmering
like beaten gold.</p>

<p>And then he lay at my feet, covering them with kisses.
And instantly all his force, his courage, his eloquence
returned.</p>

<p>He went away like a man a-dreaming.</p>

<p>I long for him; I confess I long for him. Whether
I love him or not I don't know. But that I know, I <i>will</i>
love him.</p>

<p>And if I cannot, what matters it? I don't have to
love to be happy. To <i>be</i> loved is enough. I want to be
his Queen, his life.</p>

</p>

<p>Privy Councillor von Barthels told the King that my
delicate condition needs constant watching. I go to his
clinic every second day, while he visits me once or twice
daily at the palace.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Like Melita I am never a bit repentant of my peccadilloes.</p>

<p>If I don't want to do a thing, neither Kaiser, King,
George, Frederick Augustus, my parents, the Pope, nor
the whole world, can make me. But if I resolve to follow
my sweet inclinations, rueing and pining are out of question.</p>

<p>Ferdinand is the most devoted of lovers. He has
unlimited tendernesses&mdash;a new experience for me.</p>

<p>The lover of my girlhood days overwhelmed me by
audacity. The Shah used me like a show-girl. Romano
was imperious, super-mannish. For him I was only the
female of the species.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the midst of an embrace, Ferdinand
suddenly seems to recollect that a Queen trembles in his
arms; the master turns <i>&acirc;me damn&eacute;e</i>. I am Sultana, Louise-Catherine.</p>

<p>Like Catherine the Great, I would throw millions to
my favorites and millions more when I dismissed one.
At any rate, I would give each a hundred thousand marks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
"to furnish himself with linen and silks,"&mdash;a <i>mot</i> invented
by the Semiramis of the North.</p>

<p>No more clinic for me. Ferdinand begged so hard,
that I allowed him to introduce his wife. She came in
after we finished our "consultation," a little heap of misfortune,
execrably dressed, frightened, almost dead with
submissiveness.</p>

<p>And I am robbing this poor creature; it's like stealing
pennies from a child. And under her own roof.</p>

<p>It must not be. I am going to the country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<h4>AN ATROCIOUS ROYAL SCANDAL</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A royal couple that shall be nameless&mdash;The voluptuous Duchess&mdash;Her
husband the worst of degenerates&mdash;"What monsters
these royalties be"&mdash;Nameless outrages&mdash;A Duchess forced

</p>

<p>I am afraid to date this entry. Another terrible indictment
of royalty. And, as usual, things criminal are at
the bottom of the abuse of sovereign power.</p>

<p>The Duchess had a baby and asked me to be godmother
to the little girl. The King, eager to oblige his
rich cousin, favored the journey. I insisted that Ferdinand
accompany me. "Marie," I said, "hates Tisch, and she
must, under no circumstances, be commanded to attend
me." Lucretia would do. It would be cheaper.</p>

<p>The King first wouldn't hear of Dr. von Barthels
going. People might think I had some chronic disease.
But he finally gave in for the sake of the child I expect.
"We need a few princes more from you," said His Majesty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
benignly. "When you got about a dozen boys, you can
rest." Pleasant job, that of a Crown Princess.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 40em;">&mdash;&mdash;R</span>, <i>July 16, 1899</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The Duchess is a pretty woman, her face a lovely
oval. She has small eyes, the color of amethysts. Her
complexion is as white and harmonious as if she washed
in sow's milk, like the late Ninon.</p>

<p>Her mouth is sweet, but certain lines indicate that it
can bite as well as smile. She has abundant hair, the color
of Ferdinand's.</p>

<p>This dainty, albeit voluptuous, little person, is mated
to a bull-necked He, pompous, broad and full of the conceit
of the <i>duodez</i> satrap.</p>

<p>Marie was forced to marry him; their honeymoon
scarcely lasted a fortnight and he treated her shamefully
after that. Of course, babies she must bear like any other
"royal cow."</p>

<p>Gradually, very gradually, she got over her disappointment
and shyness, developing into a cunning, world-wise
woman. Then came the man she was bound to love, even
as the violet is bound to be kissed by the sun. She had
no scruples about accepting him, thinking herself entitled
to compensation for the sorrows of her married life. And
revenge is sweet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>The Duke found them out in the first month of their
young love, walked into her boudoir one fine afternoon
and remarked casually that none of his hats would fit him,&mdash;"on
account of the horns you kindly planted on my
forehead."</p>

<p>Marie was more dead than alive when he asked her
for the key of her writing desk. She lied and lied; to no
purpose.</p>

<p>He kicked open the writing desk, and with his iron
fists broke the shelves and pigeon holes, laying bare a
secret drawer and stacks of love letters it shielded. These
he confiscated. Then locked himself into his room to enjoy
his disgrace. This monster is a <i>Masochist</i> and Sadist
combined. He loves both to inflict suffering upon himself
and upon others.</p>

<p>What monsters royalties be!</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Marie experienced all the tortures
of purgatory; she thought of flight, of suicide. Before
she could indulge in either her husband was back: Othello
in the last act.</p>

<p>Marie was frightened stiff, her brain a whirl, her
limbs inert. Rape most foul this crowned satyr committed.
"He fell upon me as a pack of hounds overwhelm a hunted,
wounded she-stag," she said.</p>

<p>Afterwards he commanded her to describe minutely
every detail of her relations with the other. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
primed with the letter-accounts; he made her dot her
amorous I's and cross her bawdry T's. And every attempt
at omission he punished with kicks and cuffs; no drayman
or brick-layer could give a more expert exhibition of
woman-beating! And he violated her again.</p>

<p>This was the beginning of a series of outrages of the
same gross character. Marie suffered for years and years
that His Royal Highness may gratify his unclean fancies:
he the pander; she the Cyprian.</p>

<p>"If I ceased having lovers, I think he would kill me,"
says Marie.</p>

<p>Alas, such is the stuff "God's Anointed" are made of!
In the face of such, we pronounce a hypocritical <i>j'accuse</i>
upon the Louis's and Pompadours, upon Marie Antoinette
even.</p>

<p>The Duchess, who knows, gave Ferdinand an apartment
near my own. We are living here like man and
wife. He sometimes calls me "<i>Frau Professor</i>."</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>July 19, 1899</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Marie is dead. "Died suddenly," said the telegram.
I understand now why she begged me, with tears in her
eyes, to remain at least two weeks. She was afraid that,
though ill and suffering after the confinement, he would
treat her as he did when he first found her unfaithful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't go," she cried. "It will be my death." And
when I showed her the King's letter commanding me to
return at once, she made her confidential tire-woman swear
on the Bible that she wouldn't leave her for a minute,
day or night, until she herself released her from the
promise.</p>

<p>Private advices from &mdash;&mdash;r say His Highness
brutally kicked the faithful maid out of his wife's bedroom
and outraged his sick wife while the servant kept
thundering at the door, denouncing her master a murderer.</p>

<p>Ferdinand says the great majority of crowned heads
are sexual voluptuaries, deserving of the penitentiary or
the straight-jacket.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>August 1, 1899</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I caught the Tisch stealing one of my letters. Happily
there was nothing incriminating in it, though addressed
to Ferdinand,&mdash;just the letter the Crown Princess would
write to a Privy Councillor. But the petty theft indicates
that she suspects. Prince George, I am told, receives a
report from her every few days.</p>

<p>Well, I had my revenge. The Queen called today to
see the children, and when Her Majesty and myself withdrew
into my closet, the Tisch, who had been spying,
didn't retire as promptly as she might.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you see that you are <i>de trop</i>," I said sharply
to her. "Please close the door from outside." The
Baroness gave a cry of dismay and the Queen was scandalized.</p>

<p>"Louise," she said, "that is no way to treat servants.
You should always try to be kind and considerate with
them."</p>

<p>"I am, thanks, Your Majesty," I replied. "All the officials
and servants love me, but I have very good reasons for
treating the Tisch as I do."</p>

<p>Of course, George will hear of this, and the Tisch will
be reprimanded by him as well. Spies that compromise
themselves, compromise their masters.</p>

<p>The same evening I said to the Tisch in the presence
of the nurses:</p>

<p>"My dear Baroness, I wish you would display a little
more tact. Listen at my doors as much as you like, but
whatever you do, don't spy on Her Majesty in my house."
She exuded a flood of tears and I sent her to her room.
"Don't come back until you can show a pleasant face. I
want to see none other around me."</p>

<p>Ferdinand received a medical report from &mdash;&mdash;r.
My first private advices regarding Marie's death were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
correct, but the additional details given are too horrible
to contemplate.</p>

<p>The poor Duchess was brutally murdered. She died
cursing her crowned murderer.</p>

<p>The manner in which she was put to death can only be
likened to that of the lover in Heinrich von Kleist's poetically
sublime, but morally atrocious, tragedy, <i>Penthesilcia</i>,
except that, in poor Marie's case, the <i>woman</i> suffered from
the awful frenzy of the male, in whom the "gentlest passion"
degenerated in Saturnalia of revolting cruelty. The
Duke killed Marie because <i>doing so gave him the most

<p>Frederick Augustus sent for Ferdinand and gave him
to understand that he had received divers anonymous letters,
connecting my name with that of the Privy Councillor.
"Of course I don't believe a word of it," said my husband,
"but one in my position cannot afford to flout public opinion.
It will be for the best, if you cease your services to Her
Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>Upon the same day Ferdinand received orders from
the King to stop his visits.</p>

<p>The Baroness's doings, of course,&mdash;pin-pricks when she
would like to shoot with sharp cartridges. She evidently
doesn't know the full extent of our intimacy. As to
Ferdinand, he acted the coward, left my letters unanswered
and didn't make the slightest attempt to continue relations
that might possibly turn out to his disadvantage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>He is contemptible. My heart is unengaged, but my
pride sadly humbled.</p>

<p>The King sent me an emerald, one-twentieth the size
of that given me by the Shah of Persia. Frederick Augustus
did himself proud and, on his part, I gained a pearl
necklace in acknowledgment of my renewed services to
the state. Little Marguerite was born January 24.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus also gave me five thousand marks
spending money. Not much for a multi-millionaire's wife
or daughter, I reckon, but a terrible lot for an Imperial
Highness.</p>

<p>When I read of the sums the Vanderbilts, Astors,
Goulds and other dollar-kings spend in Paris and London,
and even with us in Dresden, I sometimes wish I could
exchange places with an American Duchess or Countess
long enough to buy all the things beautiful and pretty I
would like to own. An awful thing is royal poverty, but
the reputation of affluence and unlimited resources, stalking
ahead of us, whenever we enter a store or bargain
with a jeweler, is worse.</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Highness is pleased to joke," says my
man-milliner, when I admit, unblushingly, that I haven't
the wherewithal to buy the things I dote on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Wait till I am Queen, modistes, store-keepers, jewelers!
The new Majesty will show you that she cares for money
only to get rid of it.</p>

<p>This morning Lucretia came running to the nursery
and whispered to me: "Imperial Highness, quick, to the
boudoir. He begged so hard, I smuggled him in."</p>

<p>She couldn't say more, for the Tisch was watching us.
What new trouble was brewing? Could it be Romano,
dare-devil, who had come back to me?</p>

<p>If it was that poltroon, Ferdinand, I would have him
thrown out by my lackeys.</p>

<p>The mysterious visitor doffed wig and false moustache.
"It's me," cried Bernhardt. "You are my only hope."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing again?"</p>

<p>"They threaten to banish my girl from the garrison
and I won't stand for it. If they send her away or imprison
her, I will kick up such a row, all Europe shall hear of it."</p>

<p>"But why this masquerade?"</p>

<p>"S-s-sh!" whispered the young prince. "I came without
leave." Quickly, breathlessly, he continued: "I hear
you are in His Majesty's good graces. Go and see him
on my behalf. Persuade him to annul the order of banishment
or render it ineffective."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bernhardt," I said, "why don't you marry?"</p>

<p>"If I could get a girl like you, Louise, I would&mdash;today,
tomorrow, but the royal scare-crows that will have penniless
me,&mdash;much obliged! You are a very exceptional woman,"
he added earnestly.</p>

<p>We held a council of war, discussing the situation from
every view-point, and finally I agreed to see Baumann.</p>

<p>"I'll have to vouch for your future good conduct," I
said.</p>

<p>"On condition that they leave my girl alone."</p>

<p>"Precisely. And on your part you give me your word
of honor not to scandalize the people of your new garrison;
to gradually break with the girl and, in the end, get married."</p>

<p>"You are a brick, Louise," cried Bernhardt, and before
I could shake him off, he was kissing me all over my face.
No cousinly or brotherly kisses! His lips were apart, there
was passion in his embrace. I struggled, but his hand
pressed against my back. What strength the rascal's got!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>February 21, 1900</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The King is adamant. I no sooner mentioned Bernhardt's
name than his face froze.</p>

<p>"Does your husband know about your interference for
that rake?"</p>

<p>When I answered in the negative, he praised Frederick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
Augustus for strict submission to the royal will and upbraided
me for "upholding Bernhardt in his wickedness."</p>

<p>"The boy is desperate," I said.</p>

<p>"If he is desperate," cried the King, "let him do the
one reasonable and honorable thing: mend his evil ways.
It will come easy if he seeks true strength in prayer, in
fasting and religious discipline."</p>

<p>"I submit to your Majesty that it might be well to send
Bernhardt travelling."</p>

<p>"On a tour of inspection of houses of ill-fame?" interrupted
Albert coldly. "This is a mere waste of words," he
added, looking towards the door, "and I'm sorry that
Your Imperial Highness has the bad taste to take the part
of this disobedient, immoral and altogether reprehensible
<i>Lausbub</i>."</p>

<p>That meant my dismissal. I shudder when I think of
the consequences of the King's obstinacy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Asked to play the coward, and I refuse&mdash;A hostler who would
die for a look from me&mdash;Hostler marriages in royal houses&mdash;Anecdotes
and unknown facts concerning royal ladies and

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>July 3, 1900</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Behold Louise, a political personage!</p>

<p>I was driving with my little ones in the <i>Bois</i> yesterday
afternoon. We occupied an open court carriage, conspicuous
for livery and magnificent horse-flesh, for I love display
and the children enjoy it. We were driving along leisurely
enough when there was hasty clatter of hoofs and wheels
behind. Presently a royal <i>coup&eacute;</i> dashed up alongside.</p>

<p>The Tisch stuck her head out:</p>

<p>"Imperial Highness&mdash;the town's in revolt.&mdash;Socialist
riot. They are marching upon the palace.&mdash;For the love
of God, return at once. Your Imperial Highness must take
a seat in this inconspicuous carriage. We will change to
the first <i>Droschke</i> we meet, going through side-streets."</p>

<p>"My dear Baroness," I answered, "it's not in my nature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to shirk peril. If I were to be hanged and quartered and
could avoid that unpleasantness by changing from my carriage
to a cab&mdash;I would be hanged and quartered. Take
the children and return to the palace any way you like.</p>

<p>"As for me, I'll go back as Her Imperial Highness, the
Crown Princess of Saxony, and my coachman will drive
slowly."</p>

<p>I kissed the children, and the <i>coup&eacute;</i> rolled away at a
sharp clip.</p>

<p>Calling the coachman by name, I commanded him:
"You heard what my Grand Mistress said. Riot or no
riot, I am solely responsible for my own safety. You will
take orders from no one but me, neither from the mob nor
the police."</p>

<p>The coachman lifted his hat respectfully and bowed
a submissive "At Your Imperial Highness's orders." The
groom, a young, good-looking fellow, struck the broadsword
at his side.</p>

<p>"There is some good steel in this, Your Imperial Highness,"
he said with sparkling eyes. I believe this poor
fellow would have died for a single look from me.</p>

<p>Among royal servants, the most devoted are those connected
with the <i>Marstall</i>. No wonder so many of my sisters
born on the steps of the throne, fell in love with their
Master of Horse or equerries; some with mere hostlers, like
Queen Christina of Spain, the mother of my aunt Isabelle,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of amorous memory. Her lover, Munoz, of the Body
Guards, was a famous equestrian and two years younger
than Christina. He managed horses so well, she thought
it would be great fun to boss this giant. But it ended by
the brute lording it over her, the "Catholic Majesty." By
the way, I wonder what became of Christina's and Munoz's
several children. While they lived together from 1833 to
1844 without the sanction of either law or church, they
were "regularly married" in the end, the hostler, Munoz,
metamorphosing into Duke Rianzares. Yet the <i>Almanach
de Gotha</i> knows not their progeny when, as "love children,"
they should live long and happily.</p>

<p>Another "hostler-marriage" occurred in the family of
the proud Kaiser, the contracting parties being Princess
Albrecht of Prussia and a groom, whose name I forget.
This Princess, Marianne of the Netherlands, brought the
first "real" money into the Hohenzollern family, and her
husband, Albrecht, was long regarded the Cr&oelig;sus among
German princes.</p>

<p>After the divorce, His Royal Highness forced the ex-wife
to marry the hostler, and the bloom of forbidden love
having worn off in the meantime, Marianne seldom passed
a day without being soundly beaten by the plebeian. Maybe
she liked it. Some women do.</p>

<p>Today her offspring with Master Fisticuffs are sturdy
farmers in Silesia, but two of the three sons she had with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the royal Prince, as well as the sons the royal Prince had
with his second wife, Rosalie von Rauch, are degenerates.
Rosalie's sons are known as Counts Hohenau and the wife
of the elder, Fritz, is giving my astute and pious cousin,
the Kaiserin, considerable heart-ache.</p>

<p>Curious, isn't it? The children of the "adulteress"
are successful men and women, aids in the progress of the
world; those of the blood royal, in double or single doses,
a menace to public morality. This much for your royal
inbred custom.</p>

<p>But back to Dresden. The order to drive slowly was
soon rescinded, for I was burning to see a riot at close
range. "<i>Plein carri&egrave;re</i>," I commanded, and my fast <i>Carrossiers</i>
went at a tremendous rate for two miles. The moment
I saw, in the distance, knots of people standing round or
moving in the direction of the palace, I cried: "<i>Schritt</i>,"
and we proceeded as leisurely as if following a funeral.</p>

<p>As we turned around a corner, a detachment of gendarmes,
sent to watch for me, hove into sight. Their commanding
officer signalled frantically to the coachman to stop,
but George had his instructions and proceeded.</p>

<p>The officer spurred his horse and rode up to me, questioning
me with his eyes.</p>

<p>"My orders," I explained.</p>

<p>"Then I must escort Your Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>"Don't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>"Strict orders from my superior officer, Your Imperial
Highness," and the gendarmes formed a <i>cordon</i> around my
carriage.</p>

<p>I was furious. "Send for your commander."</p>

<p>The captain of the gendarmes could not be found at
once and joined my cavalcade only when we were opposite
a living wall of excited people, nearly all of them workmen.</p>

<p>"What is Your Imperial Highness's pleasure?" asked
the captain, bending down from his horse.</p>

<p>"Send your men away instantly."</p>

<p>"But the responsibility?"</p>

<p>"Rests with me and with me only. Send them away.
Every one of them."</p>

<p>The mob was watching us. I read suspicion in the
eyes of those nearest. The captain gave the sign and the
troopers turned their horses' heads, saluting me with their
drawn swords.</p>

<p>"May I act as Your Imperial Highness's out-rider?"
asked the captain in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself. I command you."</p>

<p>The groom had been watching us. I gave the signal
and we proceeded at a pace. The rampart of human bodies
swung open and lined the sides of the streets. Someone
cried: "Three cheers for the Crown Princess," and everyone
responded.</p>

<p>These Socialists, whom I had been taught to hate and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
despise, behaved in exemplary style. When I dismissed
their tyrants, the gendarmes, they immediately took me
under their protection. I am sure anyone daring to insult
me, or raise a hand against me, would have fared badly at
the hands of his fellows.</p>

<p>I was all smiles, bowing right and left. Labor
agitators raised their hats to me, mothers offered their
children that I might pat their little hand, or lay mine
on their head&mdash;a veritable triumph!</p>

<p>When I drove into the palace yard, the Guards rushed
out to do me honor. The Queen, the King and Prince
George saluted me from the windows of their apartments.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus embraced me in front of everybody.
In short I was made a hero of.</p>

<p>I afterwards learned that as soon as the palace knew
of the incipient riot, the King sent word to all members
of the royal family, ordering them to stay in their apartments.
They were even forbidden to show themselves at
the windows overlooking the palace square.</p>

<p>Learning that I had gone driving, mounted grooms
were dispatched in all directions to intercept me. The
Tisch, being responsible for the royal children, got the
fastest team the court commands and started for the <i>Bois</i>.</p>

<p>It gave me some satisfaction to observe that I arrived
before her. Of course, I never doubted the children's
safety.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The evening papers devoted columns to the little incident
and Prince George had the great sorrow to hear the
King say: "A dare-devil, that Louise, but she did the right
thing. By pretending confidence in the loyalty of the
people, she successfully gulled them. The riot's back was
broken when she showed a bold front."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>Dance at the royal summer residence. Concentrated
<i>ennui</i> as a rule, but a complete success this time.</p>

<p>I have seen Him,&mdash;capital "H." He is the one man
for me.</p>

<p>I am happy; I am myself again. All sorrows are forgotten.
I am ten years younger.</p>

<p>Love at first sight. I the aggressor. I must be getting
very clever since I managed to hide it from hundreds of
searching eyes, even from my entourage.</p>

<p>"Lucretia," I whispered breathlessly to my confidante,
"find out the name of the <i>Vort&auml;nzer</i>, quick."</p>

<p>The <i>Vort&auml;nzer</i>, at royal courts, is a sort of official
master of the dance, who sets the pace for the company,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
combining the duties of master of ceremonies and of dancing
master.</p>

<p>The more I looked at the <i>Vort&auml;nzer</i>, the more he
enchanted me. Taller than any other man present, elegant,
blonde, clean-shaven. Not an ounce of superfluous flesh,
I judged. Might be the reincarnation of the <i>Duc</i> de Richelieu,
who seduced my three cousins d'Orleans.</p>

<p>His face is livid with white and carmine tints; his
eyes glow with an irresistible charm. That figure of his!
The elegance of the palm tree, both straight and flexible.
And the infinity of grace as he waltzed that little Baroness
around.</p>

<p>"Baron Bergen, of the Guards," breathed Lucretia into
my ear.</p>

<p>"My Master of Ceremony will command Baron Bergen
at the end of this dance."</p>

<p>When he stood before me, bowing and smiling, the idea
that he was Richelieu reincarnated became almost a certainty
with me.</p>

<p>Like Richelieu, his face has the refinement that we
admire in women (I forgot to say that I became infatuated
with him merely from seeing a back view of the man.
When he turned around, I was lost).</p>

<p>While he chanted the usual compliments, my eyes hung
upon his cherry lips, reveled in his white, strong teeth.
The man I want. I say it without shame, without care.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Blush, good, white paper! I am giving an account
of my feelings, and if they be impure, there's something
wrong with nature.</p>

<p>Even as I write, I tremble with longing, with desire
for Henry.</p>

<p>Ten days since we first met. It might have been this
morning, so lively and overwhelming is the recollection.
I am impatient for his kisses, for his blonde loveliness,
for his whole self,&mdash;just as if we hadn't loved and kissed
scarce an hour ago.</p>

<p>"My horse, Lucretia. We'll go for a canter. I must
have air and plenty of it."</p>

<p>I must give some additional account of our first meeting
at the court ball. Ah, I was the hussy for fair! He
couldn't help seeing the impression he made upon me. My
eyes must have reflected it in letters of flame. I wish he
were as bold as the <i>Duc</i>, who slept on a pillow stuffed
with the hair of his mistresses, past and present.</p>

<p>I never made such advances to any man. I was gone
clean off my head.</p>

<p>When he reddened and when his left hand, resting on
the hilt of his sword, trembled, I became intoxicated.</p>

<p>And I danced with him, and I was angry with myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
for lacking the courage to say: "Feel my heart beat." My
great-great-aunt and namesake, Marie Antoinette, did and
won the love of her life,&mdash;Fersen.</p>

<p>But we <i>fin de si&egrave;cle</i> women are cowards. All I said
to him was: "I must see you tonight. Arrange with
Lucretia."</p>

<p>Summer heat continues, but no country-seat for me!
The town is a much safer place for lovers, and old Countess
Baranello keeps open house for us all the year round. We
meet daily. I persuaded Henry's colonel that the lieutenant
would never be a courtier unless he saw more of court
life and was relieved, to a certain extent, of duties on the
drill ground.</p>

<p>We see each other mornings or afternoons at the
Countess's. The evenings we spend at the theatre together,
I in the box, he in the <i>fauteuil</i> once sacred to Romano.
Every Saturday afternoon we concoct the repertoire for
the week following, and he goes at once to secure tickets
for the various entertainments I intend to visit for his
sake.</p>

<p>I wish I had never loved any man before Henry. I
wish he had known me as an innocent girl. I wish I wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
royal. Then I could get a divorce and marry him, but
now, if I got ten divorces, he would always be the insignificant
Baron, I the Princess of the Blood.</p>

<p>And I couldn't see my love humiliated!</p>

<p>As a talisman he wears on his chest a golden locket
with my miniature. In exchange he gave me a <i>Portebonheur</i>
with his picture and a few sweet words.</p>

<p>So help me, God, I am in love with this man,&mdash;love
him to the verge of poetry. Indeed, I am writing silly
verse in his honor, and later haven't the courage to show
it to him. <i>Par example</i>:</p>

<p>
I want you most, dear, when the sunset bright<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes of the hills a glorious funeral pyre,</span><br />
So die the love-light in your eyes, if die it must,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And leave the wondrous, throbbing silence of the night.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Henry isn't very intellectual, I am afraid, but he is
the finest horseman in the world.</p>

<p>If I were Queen, I would barter a regiment to have
him appointed my Chief Master of Horse. Augustus of
the three-hundred and fifty-two sold one for his first night
with Cosel.</p>

<p>I am racking my brains for a pretense to have him
appointed to court duty,&mdash;anything to give him the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
to my apartments. But he is far too beautiful. The sancti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>monious
cats that envy me my happiness, that look upon
love as a crime, would at once combine to destroy him.</p>

<p>Well, we'll have to bear with the difficulties of the
situation forced upon us by these moral busy-bodies. As
for me, I'll be thrice careful, for if He was taken away
from me, all the joy would go out of my life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>
When one is in love and loved a-plenty, weeks and months roll by without notice by the happy ones.</p>

<p>For my part I never thought there was so much happiness
in the world as I am experiencing since the beginning
of September. But I have my troubles, too. First,
the Tisch. When a lady is well pleased by her lover, then
her eyes are bright, her cheeks glow, her lips smile; she
bears with her entourage; she is kind to her servants.
The moment I treated the Tisch as a human being, she
began to suspect, and I am sure she is eating her heart
out fretting because God gave me both nuts and teeth to
crack them.</p>

<p>But I am qualifying as an expert deceiver, and my
Grand Mistress won't catch me in a hurry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>My other great trouble is: long separations from Henry,
hours upon hours in daytime, half the nights.</p>

<p>What is he doing when he is not with me? Of course
he pretends to tell, but I am not goose enough to suppose
that he would incriminate himself for the love of truth.
He is hiding things from me, perhaps cheating me. I have
to arm myself with all the faith loving woman commands
to forestall occasional noisy out-breaks of jealousy.</p>

<p>Was there ever a good-looking man, women didn't try
to capture and seduce? Manly beauty is the red rag that
enthralls and excites women and renders them dishonest,
though their honor doesn't lodge at the point they designate
as its <i>habitat</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when in these jealous frenzies, I wish
Henry had a face like a Chinese kite, or like Riom, husband
and lover of my ancestress, the Duchess du Berri.</p>

<p>She was "<i>satisfied</i>" with him, but since her lady-in-waiting,
too, was, I might, after all, fare no better than
Berri, if Henry was a toad, "his skin spotted like a serpent's,
oily like a negro's, changeable like a chameleon, with a
turned up nose and disproportionate mouth." Yet I hardly
believe that, like my cousin, I would say anent a rival:
"Whoever would not be satisfied with him, would be hard
to please."</p>

<p>Alas, with women in love the extreme of ugliness
counts as triumphantly as the charms of Adonis. Ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
since I read certain passages of Faust, part II, Eduard
von Hartmann's "Philosophy of the Unconscious," and Lermontoff's
"Hero of our Times," I am convinced that to
love a man very good-looking, or, on the contrary, a perfect
horror, is no sinecure.</p>

<p>Fortunately Henry is almost penniless.</p>

</p>

<p>Henry's sister married one of the numerous Vitzthums,
of the family that furnished the Saxon court with titled
servants and <i>ma&icirc;tresses en titre</i> for the past several hundred
years.</p>

<p>I immediately sent word to her ladyship, that having
taken up bicycling, I would be pleased to have her attend
me on the wheel on the afternoon following. The invitation
was issued from the office of my Court Marshal,
which is controlled by the King's. Having thus secured
beforehand His Majesty's approval, possible criticism was
nipped in the bud. The bride asked permission to bring
her husband.</p>

<p>"Granted. Order of dress: <i>mufti</i>."</p>

<p>This enabled us, myself and Henry, and the Count
and Countess to ride all over town, unrecognized by either
officials or the public at large.</p>

<p>It was great fun, and I told the Vitzthums that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
intended to wheel every morning at nine, immediately after
breakfast. Count Vitzthum is Henry's colonel. Of course
he granted both Henry and himself furlough for the time set.</p>

<p>What happiness! Now I don't have to wait till afternoon
and evening to see my lover.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>January 10, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I am so happy, I am growing careless.</p>

<p>The Vitzthums, profiting by the fact that they are but
recently married, prefer to travel in pairs, and always take
the lead. Accordingly Henry and myself, incog. as far
as my future subjects go, are free to indulge in occasional
caresses and sweet nonsense-talk.</p>

<p>I was pouring honeyed words into Henry's ears the
other morning when my wheel skidded on the wet pavement,
and before he, or I, could save me, I was down on
my back in the mud.</p>

<p>The fact that I was again <i>enceinte</i>, and the other fact
that I was covered with dirt, ought to have prompted me to
return to the palace at once, but how un-Louise-like the
straight and sane course would have been.</p>

<p>I allowed myself to be wiped off by Henry; then
mounted my wheel anew and raced after the Vitzthums.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a reporter heard of the incident and,
for the benefit of his pocket, made a column out of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>A few hours after the story appeared in the evening paper,
the palace was in an uproar. The King wasn't well enough
to scold me, so he delegated that pleasant duty to Prince
George. His Royal Highness promptly informed me that
the "damned bicycling had to stop."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

was in debt and I gave him money&mdash;Indignities by
which some of that money was earned&mdash;Husband accompanies
me to Loschwitz&mdash;Reflections on Frederick Augustus's
character.</p></div>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 38em;"><i>January 15, 1901.</i></span>
</p>

<p>My love played the melancholy Dane for the last few
days. His tenderness seemed labored, his spirits under a
cloud. Every smile I got had to be coaxed from him.</p>

<p>"The end of my happiness," I thought; "some chit of
a girl dethroned me." And I cursed my birthday. "A
kingdom for ten years off my age."</p>

<p>And my thoughts of thoughts travelled back to the
times when royal ladies had their rivals immured, as practiced
by a Brandenburg princess at the Kaiser's hunting
box at Gr&uuml;newald, or made a head shorter, like Lady Jane
Grey, who was far too pretty to please Elizabeth; or shot,
as elected by Queen Christina, <i>tribade</i> and nymphomaniac
both.</p>

<p>And the things Queen Bess did to her unfaithfuls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the crimes Mary Stuart perpetrated to cheat Jeannie Bothwell
out of her doughty Hepburn!</p>

<p>"If I were Queen," I thought, and I must have spoken
aloud, for Henry said: "You would make me a great lord,
love, wouldn't you, give me the best paying office at court,
but that's small comfort to my creditors today."</p>

<p>"It's creditors, mere creditors bothering you?" I almost
shouted with joy. This man was still mine. No one
had succeeded in luring him away from me. I threw myself
upon him and nearly smothered him.</p>

<p>Filthy lucre, or the want of it, oppressing my boy.
Money, miserable money, caused me to doubt his very
loyalty.</p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>He stuttered and denied and swore it was all a mistake
and that I had misunderstood him. "As an army
officer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk like Frederick Augustus. It will give me
the greatest pleasure in the world to arrange your affairs,
dearest."</p>

<p>I got him to name the sum after a while. What a
pity I am not rich. As Catharine sent her Orloffs and
Potemkins and Zoritchs to the State Treasury to help themselves
as they saw fit, so I would gladly turn fortunes over
to Henry, never asking for an accounting.</p>

<p>But this Imperial Highness is wretchedly poor, like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
most royal women not actually seated on the throne. I
can't offer my paramour financial independence, not even
luxury, but, thank heaven, I saved up enough to provide
for his present needs, even if my treasury be drained to
the last twenty-mark piece, and I will have to cut short
my charities for the next quarter of a year. But he must
not know these sordid details.</p>

<p>Some day I will be Queen. I will reimburse the poor
and I will be a true Catharine to Henry.</p>

</p>

<p>I brought my mite to our rendezvous. Mostly in small
bills and twenty-mark pieces. If Henry knew that many
of these were earned in the right royal fashion of having
them slipped down one's stocking by a husband, too drunk
to distinguish a royal palace from a dance-hall!</p>

<p>He told me honestly enough how he got into debt.
"How can one lay by for a rainy day when one hasn't got
anything?"</p>

<p>I appreciate the play of words, for I am in the same
predicament.</p>

<p>Only once has Henry touched a card, but he lost
considerably in horse deals, as most young army officers
do.</p>

<p>His sister made a rich marriage, but he wouldn't dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>cover
himself to her. If she asked money of her husband,
there might be trouble, for Vitzthum is not a liberal man.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>April 1, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The children's health called for country air and I was
quasi-forced to retire to Loschwitz, though I have a thousand
and one reasons for remaining in Dresden. Frederick
Augustus accompanies us. After the strenuous city life
(in Dresden!), he needs a change and a long rest from
drinking and carousing, he says boastingly.</p>

<p>Of course, while he is here, I dare not invite the Vitzthums.
But as soon as he is gone, they shall come for a
couple of weeks, and their presence will make Henry's
possible.</p>

<p>It's dreadful the way I miss the sweet boy. I suffer
like a dog, when the longing seizes me, suffer both in heart
and body. When I contemplate his miniature, tears come
into my eyes. I often cry for hours thinking of him.</p>

<p>And to have to endure this great booby of a husband
of mine day and night, especially nights. It's almost more
than I can bear.</p>

<p>The grossness of his egotism reminds me of the story
told of King James, whom the English got rid of in 1689.</p>

<p>The Dutch William, instead of waiting peacefully for
the heritage of his father-in-law, went to claim it before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
his death, and James, pressed on all sides by enemies, decided
upon flight.</p>

<p>One Sunday, in the month of December, his devotions
over, he dismissed all his servants and advised his last partisans
to turn towards the rising sun.</p>

<p>After which, he lay for an hour with his wife, the
better to take leave of her."</p>

<p>The very thing Frederick Augustus would do if war
or revolution made us fugitives.</p>

<p>I never realized the diversity in our natures as much
as I do now, when all my thoughts go out to another, when
even connubial tendernesses seem like whip-strokes.</p>

<p>The further our souls draw apart, the more disgusting
this forced intimacy, the prostitution under the marriage
vow, which I detest and abhor.</p>

<p>But what will I do? Shut my door to him? He would
kick it in, or climb through the window. It's easier to
submit to the violation of my person than to breaking of
locks and furniture.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<h4>LOVE'S INTERMEZZO</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Bernhardt takes advantage of my day-dreams&mdash;My husband's indolent
<i>gaucherie</i>&mdash;Violent love-making&mdash;Ninon who loved
families, not men&mdash;Does Bernhardt really love me?</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>April 10, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Fortunately Bernhardt came for a few days to relieve
the monotony of my alcove life <i>par le droit du plus fort</i>.</p>

<p>Tall stories of dissipation, indiscipline, scandal, had
preceded the poor fellow. No doubt, his military superiors
got orders to make his life as unhappy as they possibly can,
and he retaliates.</p>

<p>The Prince told me that, at last, he had succeeded arranging
for an audience with the King. His Majesty had
denied himself to Bernhardt for months past. He managed
the coveted boon only by the intervention of various
high generals and the threat to appeal to the Kaiser.</p>

<p>The Royal House of Saxony, while compelled to recognize
William as War-Lord, doesn't court his interference,
or attempted interference, in matters military.</p>

<p>Flushed with this initial success and expecting lots of
good things in the future, Bernhardt was bent upon having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
a good time. He drank with Frederick Augustus, made
love to Lucretia and squeezed the chambermaids on his
floor to his heart's content.</p>

<p>To me he was the most gallant of cousins and, glad to
contribute to the happiness of the poor fellow, I gave him
plenty of rope, perhaps too much.</p>

<p>On the second day of his stay we had a very merry
dinner, having dispensed for the time with titled servants.</p>

<p>After dinner the three of us retired to the veranda. I
was in a rocker, showing perhaps more of my ankles than
was absolutely necessary. Frederick Augustus was smoking
dreamily. Like an animal he likes to sleep after he has
gorged himself.</p>

<p>Bernhardt, with my permission, had thrown himself
on a wicker lounge and was absorbing cigarettes at a killing
rate. I bantered him on his laziness. But he only sighed.</p>

<p>"You wish that audience was past and forgotten," I
asked.</p>

<p>"Pshaw, I'm thinking of something prettier than the
King."</p>

<p>Remembering Bernhardt's chief weakness, I indulged in
the old joke, "<i>Cherchez la femme</i>."</p>

<p>Bernhardt replied, with another succession of groans,
"You are right, Louise; <i>parfaitement, cherchez la femme</i>."</p>

<p>"Egads," grunted Frederick Augustus, glad for an excuse
to go to his room, or play a game of pinochle with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
his aides, "egads, if you indulge in intellectualities, I had
better go. A full stomach and French conversation&mdash;whew!"</p>

<p>The Tisch was in Dresden; <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> von Schoenberg
with the children, Lucretia flirting somewhere at a
neighboring country chalet. We were alone on the remote
terrace and it was getting dark. Bernhardt sat up and
looked at me with eyes of life-giving fire, but continued
silent.</p>

<p>"You want me to think that you command the rays
of the sun stolen by Prometheus?"</p>

<p>He answered not, but sought to burn the skin of my
neck and bosom by those Prometheus rays.</p>

<p>Now, in the morning I got a note from Henry, and I
had been thinking of the dear boy every minute. I was
longing for him; my heart, my senses were crying for him.</p>

<p>I forgot Bernhardt; I forgot all around me. With my
fancies focussed on my lover, I leaned back in my armchair,
gazing at the rising moon. My word, at that moment
I was lost to everything.</p>

<p>I half-awoke from my dream when I heard Bernhardt
rise. A moment later I felt his eyes prowling over my
body. Then a shadow darkened my face and Bernhardt
said with a strange quaver in his voice:</p>

<p>"<i>Cherchez la femme.</i> You are the woman, Louise, you
and none else."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>And wild, forbidden kisses burned on my face, on my
neck, on my breasts. Both hands claimed a lover's liberties.</p>

<p>I was taken completely unawares; in my mind of minds
I was in the Countess's pavilion, receiving Henry's caresses.
All sense of location had vanished. And, thinking of my
lover, I clasped both arms about Bernhardt's neck and drew
him to me. We kissed like mad. The love feast for Henry
became Bernhardt's in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>Whether he felt like a thief, I don't know; for
my part my senses responded to Henry, not to his
substitute.</p>

<p>How long this embrace lasted, I don't know. Somebody,
or some noise, caused us to separate.</p>

<p>I fled and locked myself in my room.</p>

<p>"Tell His Royal Highness he must excuse me. I can't
see him before he goes away. Say I have a headache, or
the gout, I don't care which," I commanded Lucretia next
morning.</p>

<p>The previous night I had denied myself to Frederick
Augustus, though he entreated and raved.</p>

<p>While I appreciate the arch-Lais's <i>bon mot</i> that "one
can't judge of a family by a single specimen," which made
Ninon talk of her lovers <i>not</i> as Coligny, Villarceau, S&eacute;vign&eacute;,
Cond&eacute;, d'Albret, etc., but as <i>les</i> Rochefoucaults, <i>les</i>
d'Effiats, <i>les</i> Cond&eacute;s, <i>les</i> S&eacute;vign&eacute;s, etc., I was determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
not to betray Henry by the whole House of Saxony in a
single twelve-hours.</p>

<p>I wonder whether this Bernhardt loves me? Perhaps,
on his part, it was the longing for the girl he adores, as,
on mine, it was longing for Henry that drew us together
with electric force. And, of course, environment had something
to do with it: moon, opportunity, Frederick Augustus's
indolent <i>gaucherie</i>. Yes, why deny it, the good dinner
we had, the champagne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>May 1, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus leaves tomorrow. Forever, I
thought, when he put this question to me:</p>

<p>"You are keeping a Diary, Louise?"</p>

<p>I was frightened dumb. I stared at him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter," he laughed. "I'm not going to
eat you." He didn't seem to be at all perturbed.</p>

<p>"How do you know I keep a Diary?" I stuttered.</p>

<p>Nonchalantly enough he made answer: "Your bag-of-bones
Baroness told me. Full of forbidden things, I suppose,
since you regard it a state secret. You often say that
my education was sadly neglected. Maybe I can learn a
thing or two from your scribblings. Let's look 'm over."</p>

<p>By this time I had regained my composure. "Naturally,"
I said, "a Diary records thoughts and things intended
for the writer only, but if you choose to be ungentlemanly
enough to wish to peruse those pages more sacred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
than private letters, I suppose I will have to submit."</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus changed the subject, but I felt instinctively
that he was disappointed. Someone had played
on his curiosity, and to go unsatisfied is not at all in this
prince's line.</p>

<p>Of course, the someone was the Tisch, but how did
she know? I will ask her as soon as Frederick Augustus
is gone.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>May 2, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen my Diary?" I asked the Tisch
this morning.</p>

<p>"Never, Your Imperial Highness."</p>

<p>"Then how do you know I keep a Diary?"</p>

<p>"I surmised it because I saw Your Imperial Highness
write repeatedly in one and the same book." The hussy
affected a humble tone, but the note of triumph and hatred
underlying the creature's meekness did not escape me.</p>

<p>"And the mere surmise prompted you to blab to my
husband, arouse his suspicions?"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake," cried my Grand Mistress, "I had
no idea that His Royal Highness didn't know about the
Diary. Secrets between the Prince-Royal and Your Imperial
Highness&mdash;how dare I pre-suppose such a state of
things? His Royal Highness casually asked how the Crown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
Princess killed time in Loschwitz. I mentioned riding,
driving, bicycling, writing letters, writing in the Diary&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My fingers itched to slap her lying face, Grand-Duchess
of Tuscany fashion, but I kept my temper.</p>

<p>"Listen to me," I said. "While you have secret instructions
to play the serpent in my household and to betray,
for dirty money, your mistress of the Blood Imperial,
your duties as a spy are confined to my going and coming,
to my exterior conduct, to my visits outside the palace, to
my friendships, perhaps.</p>

<p>"They cannot possibly encompass my thoughts. And
my Diary is the repository of my thoughts&mdash;thoughts that
must not be defiled by your favor-seeking curiosity. Be
warned. The next time you dare act the burglar&mdash;I say
<i>burglar</i>&mdash;I will kick you out of doors like a thieving lackey."</p>

<p>She got as white as a sheet and hissed back: "Your
Imperial Highness can't dismiss me. Only His Majesty has
power&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I interrupted her with an imperious gesture.</p>

<p>"I said I will kick you out of doors like a thieving
lackey," I repeated, "and I will do so this moment if you
say another word. Whether or not His Majesty will punish
me for the act, that's <i>my</i> business. You will be on the
street and will stay on the street."</p>

<p>I pointed to the door: "I dismiss you now. You will
keep to your room for the rest of the day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw the Tisch was near collapse.</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Highness deigns to insult a defenseless
woman," she breathed as she went out.</p>

<p>Defenseless! So is the viper that attacks one's heel!
First these "defenseless" creatures goad one to madness,
then they appeal to our <i>noblesse oblige</i>. The enmity between
the Tisch and I is more intense than ever.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>The Vitzthums have been visiting for a week. Henry
lodges in the village, but spends nearly all his time in the
castle and grounds. We play tennis, polo, ball; we drive,
ride, go bicycling, we dine and sup together.</p>

<p>I ought to be the happiest woman in the world, but a
shadow dims the ideal picture my mind's eye drew of the
lover.</p>

<p>I have it recorded somewhere&mdash;I wish I hadn't, so I
might doubt my memory&mdash;that Henry told me he never
borrowed from his sister. Countess Vitzthum's confidences
to me show that he did repeatedly, that, in fact, he is forever
trying to borrow.</p>

<p>"He is a spendthrift; he cannot be trusted," said his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
sister, who loves him dearly. "He will wreck his career
if he continues at the pace he is going. Some day we may
hear of him as a waiter or cab-driver in New York."</p>

<p>These disclosures frightened me. I might forgive him
the lie, but what is he doing with the money?</p>

<p>Spending it on lewd women like Bernhardt, I suppose.</p>

<p>I said: "Oh," and Madame von Vitzthum seemed to
catch its significance. It occurred to her at once that she
had said too much and she tried to minimize her brother's
delinquencies. But I know.</p>

Substitute <i>paillards</i> for the holy ones and you have the
situation in a nutshell.</p>

<p>The Vitzthums are panderers. They always manage
to leave me alone with Henry. When we are a-wheel, they
ride a mile ahead; while playing tennis one or the other
aims the ball, every little while, to enter the open window
of a summer-house, where my lover and I can exchange
a few rapid kisses. When we are driving, without coach<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>man
or groom, of course, they always "feel like walking
a bit," while Henry and I remain in the carriage.</p>

<p>The same at the house, on the veranda. They are
always <i>de trop</i>. Vitzthum even sacrifices himself to the
extent of paying court to the Tisch and engaging her entire
attention, if it must be. He reminds me of a certain
colonel of the French army during the Regency.</p>

<p>"<i>Monseigneur</i>," said this gentleman to my cousin
d'Orleans, "permit me to employ my regiment as a guard
for my wife, and I swear to you that nobody shall go near
her but Your Highness."</p>

<p>Of course, it's very lovely of them, but rather emphasizes
the poor opinion I have of the nobility.</p>

<p>Your nobleman and noblewoman adopt all tones, all
airs, all masks, all allures, frank and false, flattering and
brutal, choleric or mild, virtuous or bawdy&mdash;anything as
long as it makes for their profit. Some months ago I met
at the Dresden court the Dowager Countess Julie Feodorowna
of Pappenheim, who told everybody she could persuade
to listen that her eldest son, Max Albrecht, had to
resign the succession, because he married beneath him, an
American heiress, Miss Wheeler of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>"Then you despise money?" I queried with a malicious
thought just entering my head.</p>

<p>"Not exactly, Your Imperial Highness," she said, "but
our house laws&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>"Those funny house laws," I smiled, "you don't say
they forbid a Pappenheim to accept half a dozen millions
from his wife, when, in days gone by, the Counts of Pappenheim's
chief income was the tax on harlotry in Franconia
and Swabia."</p>

<p>The Countess nearly dropped. "Don't be alarmed," I
said. "See the pompous looking man in the corner yonder?
It's Count Henneberg. His forbears held the fiefship
of the W&uuml;rzburg city brothel for many hundred years.
That's where the family fortune came from."</p>

<p>I am an ingrate. I bit the hand that fed me. Noble
iniquity that yields such delicious crumbs of love as Henry
and I stole in moments of ecstasy in park and parlor, in
pavilion and veranda, on our drives and rides, be blessed a
hundred times. Ah, the harvest of little tendernesses, the
sweet words I caught on the wing&mdash;recompense for the
weeks of abstinence I suffered!</p>

<p>Occasionally only, very occasionally, I feel like questioning
Henry as to the lie he was guilty of. I quizzed
his sister time and again about his relations with women.
She always gives me a knowing laugh; I wonder whether
she means to be impertinent, or is simply a silly goose.</p>

<p>I won't ask him. If he is innocent, as I sincerely hope,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
he will be offended. If he is not, he will be ashamed of
himself and will avoid me in future. It's "innocent," you
lose, and "guilty," you don't win.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>May 18, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>All-highest order to proceed to Pillnitz, the royal summer
residence, without delay&mdash;a command I cannot possibly
evade. Conveyed in curt, almost insulting terms&mdash;the
Tisch's work, no doubt.</p>

<p>It came like lightning out of a blue sky, just when
Henry and I had planned some real love-making <i>&agrave; la</i>
Dresden.</p>

<p>The Vitzthums lost no time taking their leave when
the scent of royal disgrace was in the air, and, as if to
emphasize the obscene office they had assumed, they spirited
Henry away ere we had time even to say goodbye.</p>

<p>What a life I am leading with the ogre of the King's
wrath forever hanging over me; Prince George's intrigues,
octopus-like, enmeshing me!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten years I have been Crown Princess of these realms.
Three Princes and a Princess I gave to Saxony. A fifth
child is trembling in my womb, yet every atom of happiness
that falls to my lot is moulded into a strand of the rope
fastening 'round my neck.</p>

<p>I haven't a friend in the world. A most dangerous
thing to be on good terms with the heirs to the crown.
Makes the temporary incumbent of the bauble nervous,
makes him jealous.</p>

<p>When I am Queen, I will have friends in plenty. But
then I won't need any. Immense wealth will be at my
disposal. I will have offices to distribute, titles, crosses and
stars.</p>

<p>Instead of tolerating the serpents now coiling at my
fireside ready to spring at a word from their master, I
will appoint to court offices persons I love or esteem, at
least.</p>

<p>Henry shall be my Chief Equerry; the Tisch will be
dismissed in disgrace&mdash;no pension.</p>

<p>But I am day-dreaming again. I started out to say
that I had no friends. Yet there's Bernhardt? Precisely&mdash;as
long as I am his mistress.</p>

<p>Marie is dead, Melita expects to be divorced before
the end of the year. She will be a Russian Grand-Duchess,
and the tedium of petty German court life will know her
no longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>Aside from Lucretia, there isn't a man or woman at
the Saxon court whom I can trust, for our high functionaries
are only lackeys having a bathroom to themselves.
In no other way do they differ from the
servants who are allowed one bathroom per twenty-four
heads.</p>

<p>But the high aristocracy! Its men and women flatter
us to get us into leading strings, try to make us pawns on
the political or social chess-board. As a whole, they are a
despicable lot.</p>

<p>No wonder kings of old married members of their
own family exclusively, even their sisters, <i>in re</i> of which
the learned Baron von Reitzenstein told me many interesting
details.</p>

<p>He copied especially from Egyptian records, but also
from Armenian, Babylonian and Persian, to wit:</p>

<p>Daranavausch married his niece, Phratunga.</p>

<p>His son and successor married his niece Artayanta.</p>

<p>Artaxerxes was also married to a niece of his.</p>

<p>Darius II and Parysatis married their sisters.</p>

<p>Kambyses married two of his sisters.</p>

<p>Artachschasa II married his two daughters; Kobad
his daughter Sambyke.</p>

<p>Artaviraf, the founder of a great ancient religion, married
no less than seven of his sisters&mdash;because "there were
no other women worthy of the honor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>According to that, the aristocracy of old must have
been as rotten as that of our day.</p>

<p>Lucretia is the only person I trust, and they would
have robbed me of her services long ago if my marriage
contract did not vest the power of dismissal in me.</p>

<p>Unlike me, she can afford to defy the King's wrath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Pillnitz</span>, <i>May 20, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I am undone. That malicious Tisch woman holds me
in the hollow of her hand.</p>

<p>I dropped into a sea of ice when I set foot in the castle.
Long faces, suspicious looks, frigidity everywhere.
The King treats me like a criminal. I wonder the guards
don't refuse their <i>spiel</i> at my coming and going.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Pillnitz</span>, <i>May 21, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus arrived. He doesn't say for how
long, and acts the icicle in the presence of others. At night
he seeks his "rights," seeks them brutally.</p>

<p>This afternoon he said to me:</p>

<p>"That you made me a cuckold isn't exactly killing
me; this sort of thing happened to better men than I, and&mdash;I
was almost prepared for it. But to hear it announced
from the King's lips&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Because His Majesty knows&mdash;Frederick Augustus
raved and swore I had dishonored him.</p>

<p>"If I wasn't a royal prince, I would be kicked out of the
army," he whined.</p>

<p>In short, adultery isn't so very reprehensible if the
King doesn't know.</p>

<p>Late tonight profound disquietude at court. The King
is ill.</p>

<p>Thank God, the audience I feared must be postponed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Pillnitz</span>, <i>May 22, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>It wasn't. His Majesty appointed Prince George his
representative, and I received a command to call on him
at ten sharp.</p>

<p>I wrote on the Court Marshal's brutal invitation: "I
refuse to see His Royal Highness."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the Tisch entered my apartment
with a look of triumph on her hateful face. She handed
me a letter on a golden plate and waited.</p>

<p>"Your Ladyship is dismissed," I snapped.</p>

<p>She didn't move: "I expect your Imperial Highness's
commands with respect to the royal children," she said.
"May it please Your Imperial Highness to read Prince
George's letter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>I tore open the envelope. His Majesty's representative
"graciously permits me to see my children at nine in the
morning and between five and six in the afternoon. At no
other time, and never unless Baroness Tisch is in attendance."</p>

<p>I threw the letter on the floor and trampled on it.
"Get out," I commanded the Baroness. If she hadn't gone
instantly, I believe I would have choked her.</p>

<p>So I am deemed unworthy to mother the children I
bore; and a spy is officially appointed to watch my intercourse
with the little ones lest I corrupt them. No other
inference was to be drawn from the measure.</p>

<p>"I will show them." But no sooner was the threat
launched, than a great fear clutched at my heart.</p>

<p>Was I in a position to defy them? To guard the
purity of the royal children "is the King's first duty towards
his family." If he had proof positive that I was an
impure woman, there was no use quarrelling with his decision.
Besides, moral delinquencies engender more than
physical weakness. I felt my boasted energy ebbing away
fast.</p>

<p>"I am without strength, unnerved, because Henry left
me," I lied to myself. The abandoned woman is either a
tigress or a kitten. I happen to be no tigress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<h4>PRINCE GEORGE REVEALS TO ME THE DEPTH OF HIS HATRED</h4>

how much the King and Prince George know&mdash;I
break into the nursery and stay with my children all day&mdash;Prince
George insults me in my own rooms and threatens
prison if I disobey him.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Pillnitz</span>, <i>May 23, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I caught Prince George in the park after laying in
wait for him three long hours.</p>

<p>"Why does Your Royal Highness forbid me to see my
children?" I demanded, every nerve aquiver.</p>

<p>"His Majesty's orders. He thinks you are not fit company
for growing children. You are leading a godless
life."</p>

<p>"What does Your Royal Highness mean?"</p>

<p>"What I said. A godless life, such as you entered
upon, is an invitation to the devil. Sins are the devil's
envoys. When you are black with sin, the devil himself
will come to claim you."</p>

<p>He dropped his theological lingo and continued: "My
fine daughter-in-law wants to be everybody's lady-love. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
she had her sweet will, she would ruin every young chap
in the residence and the surrounding country."</p>

<p>He looked about him and, seeing we were unobserved,
eased his bile in this pretty epigram as rank as a serpent's
saliva: "An adulterous wife, that's what you are. Satan
alone knows how many you seduced."</p>

<p>It was more than I could stand and I burst into tears.
In moments like this women always cry, but even if I
hadn't felt like doing so, I would have cried because George
hates it.</p>

<p>"Prove to me, prove to the King that you are sorry for
what you have done, return to the path of righteousness,
to God, and we will see about the children," he whispered
as he moved away.</p>

<p>"What does he know?" "How much have they found
out?" I kept saying to myself as I withdrew to my lonely
apartments.</p>

</p>

<p>This morning at eight-thirty I went to the nursery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>The Baroness tried to speak to me. I held up my
hand. "Not a word from you, or something terrible will
happen."</p>

<p><i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> von Schoenberg, who is really a sweet girl,
offered some respectful advice. I begged her to be silent.
If the door had been locked I would have forced it with
the dagger I carried in my bosom.</p>

<p>Lucretia came and whispered. "I have decided to
stay, and stay I will. Let them do their worst if they
dare," I told her.</p>

<p>I changed the children's <i>curriculum</i>. "You can drive
every day; you can't have mother every day. Let's have
some games."</p>

<p>I remained in the nursery till all the children were
asleep. They partook of the breakfast, lunch and dinner
I ordered for myself. A great treat for them. We were
very happy.</p>

<p>But I waited in vain for interference. Nothing happened
to clear the situation. Those questions were still
unanswered when I returned to my apartments.</p>

<p>I had just sat down to read the evening papers, when
Prince George entered unannounced.</p>

<p>"If ever again you dare disobey my commands"&mdash;he
shouted without preliminaries.</p>

<p>I cut him short: "Are the children yours or mine?"</p>

<p>"They belong to Saxony, to the Royal House," he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
bawled, and poured forth a torrent of abuse without giving
me a chance to put in a word. "You shall be disciplined
to the last extremity. We will imprison you in some lonely
tower, without state or attendants. You shall not see your
children from one year's end to the other."</p>

<p>"Prison for the Crown Princess? Would you dare,
Prince George?"</p>

<p>"At the Tower of Nossen rooms are in readiness for
your Imperial Highness," sneered my father-in-law as he
walked out.</p>

<p>Nossen! A ruined country-house, flanked by a medi&aelig;val
tower in the midst of swamps. The nearest habitation
miles away. Neither railway nor post-office, neither telegraph
nor telephone&mdash;just the place to bury one alive. And I
only thirty-one.</p>

<p>Augustus the Physical Strong imprisoned Countess
Cosel at Nossen six months before he sent her to her
prison-grave in Stolpen. After Cosel's departure, another
royal mistress was lodged in Nossen, and as she would
neither commit suicide, nor succumb to the fever, they
starved her to death. And it all happened in the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p>The word Nossen sent cold shivers down my spine. I
am sure I won't sleep a wink.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

threats to kill have no effect on her&mdash;Disregards

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Pillnitz</span>, <i>May 26, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>This morning I awoke a mental and physical wreck,
but determined to solve those vexatious questions: "What
do the King and Prince George know?" "What have they
found out?"</p>

<p>I slipped on a dressing-gown, fetched my small revolver
from its hiding-place in the boudoir and rang for the Tisch.</p>

<p>I received her politely enough. I was quiet, cold,
calculating. She gave a start as she observed my stony
countenance.</p>

<p>"Baroness," I said, motioning her to come nearer,
"explain the attitude assumed by His Majesty, Prince
George and the rest."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"I want to know. Do you hear, Grand Mistress? I
command you to speak," I cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>A sneer of contempt hovered about her lips. She is a
viper, this woman, but has the courage of the rattle-snake
in action.</p>

<p>I turned the keys in the several doors and threw them
under the bed. From under the pillow I drew my revolver.</p>

<p>I showed her the weapon and calmly announced,
accentuating each word: "You won't leave this room alive
until the question I put to you is answered to my satisfaction.
I want the whole truth. You needn't excuse your
own part in the business. As Henri <i>Quatre</i> said to the
lover of Diane de Poitiers, secreted under her bed, as he
threw him half a cold bird: 'We all want to live, some
honestly, some dishonestly.' You choose the dishonest road.
Be it so.</p>

<p>"But I want you to state what you accuse me of.
Hurry," I added menacingly.</p>

<p>The Tisch was unmoved. Either she thinks me a
horrible dastard or is brave to madness. She looked at
me fearlessly and smiled. She seemed to enjoy my rage.</p>

<p>"Answer or I will shoot you like the dog you are."</p>

<p>And then her cold and fearless voice rang out: "Put
your revolver away. I am not afraid to tell you, and that
thing might go off. Is it possible," she continued sarcastically,
"you have to ask?"</p>

<p>This woman dared to address me "you." "Tisch," I
thundered, "my title reads Your Imperial Highness."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>Another contemptuous smile curled her thin lips as
she answered insolently: "At your commands. But if you
want me to talk, put away the weapon. I won't open my
head while threatened."</p>

<p>I threw the revolver into a drawer of my chiffonier
and the Tisch approached me. "Do you know this?" she
hissed, whipping from her desert bosom the golden <i>Portebonheur</i>,
Henry's present.</p>

<p>I had missed it for two days. Fear seized my throat.</p>

<p>"Do you know this?" repeated the Tisch, pushing the
button and disclosing Henry's miniature with the legend
"To my sweetest Louise."</p>

<p>"Where did you get it?" I asked, half-dead with shame
and fear.</p>

<p>"Never mind. It's the last piece of evidence that
fell into my hands. The real facts I have known for a
long while."</p>

<p>"And sold that knowledge?"</p>

<p>"I did my duty."</p>

<p>"Report, then."</p>

<p>And she told the story of her infamy&mdash;or mine?</p>

<p>My true relations with Henry were discovered by her
at Loschwitz. He is a distant relative of hers and she
an intimate friend of his mother. Hence she took care not
to compromise the young man. The entire blame was put
on me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Her Imperial Highness is indulging in a dangerous
flirtation with Baron Bergen," she advised the King. "They
must be separated at once lest that exemplary young man
fall victim to her seductive wiles. I beseech Your Majesty
to order the Crown Princess to Pillnitz and put a stop to
her most reprehensible conduct."</p>

<p>Hence the royal command to proceed to Pillnitz without
a moment's delay. "The King and Prince George deem
your honor unsafe unless you are under their watchful
eyes," she had the effrontery to tell me.</p>

<p>She drew a key from her pocket and opened one of
the bedroom doors.</p>

<p>With her hand on the knob, she said, bowing formally:</p>

<p>"By Your Imperial Highness's leave, I will keep the
<i>Portebonheur</i> to use in case you are ever tempted again
'to throw me out of doors like a thieving lackey!'"</p>

<p>A low bow, a sarcastic smile,&mdash;my executioner was
gone. And I broke some priceless bric-a-brac, stamped my
foot on the pearl necklace Frederick Augustus had given
me, tore three or four lace handkerchiefs and stuffed the
rags in my mouth to prevent me from crying aloud.</p>

<p>Lucretia finished the Tisch's report. The good soul
hadn't had the courage to tell me before, but now that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Grand Mistress had spoken, considerations of delicacy no
longer stood in the way.</p>

<p>What a judge of character I am, to be sure: Henry,
whom I raised from obscurity, whom I befriended, loved,
advanced, rescued from the hands of usurers&mdash;a traitor,
pshaw, worse,&mdash;I cannot write down the word, but it's in
my mind.</p>

<p>Henry, who hadn't the time to take leave from me,
devoted an hour to the Tisch before he went away with
the Vitzthums.</p>

<p>He told her all and gave her his word of honor&mdash;the
honor of a man who accepted money from the woman
weak enough to love him&mdash;that, first, he would never see
me again of his own accord and would reject both my
entreaties and commands; secondly, that he would petition
to be transferred to a distant garrison to be out of the
path of temptation; thirdly, that he would burn my letters.</p>

<p>The Tisch, on her part, promised to tell the King
only half the truth&mdash;not for my sake, of course, but to
shield her dear, seduced young relative.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>Though I am in delicate health, the King, having
recovered from his illness, commanded me to do penance,&mdash;almost
public penance.</p>

<p>Fast and pray, pray and fast is the order of the day
for the next two weeks.</p>

<p>I arise every morning at five. At six a closed carriage
takes me to a distant nunnery of the Ursulines, a good
hour's travel. I am forced to attend mass, which also lasts
an hour. Then a half-hour's sermon, dealing with fire and
brimstone, hell and damnation.</p>

<p>When that's over the Mother Superior kindly asks me
to her cell and lectures me for an hour on the duties of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
a wife and mother, and on the terrors that follow in the
wake of adultery.</p>

<p>(I wonder where she gets her wisdom. She isn't
married, she isn't supposed to have children, and she ought
to know that the founder of her religion was most kind
to the adulteress.)</p>

<p>Then back to Pillnitz and breakfast, for it's the King's
express command that I worship on an empty stomach;
some Jesuit told George my sins would never be forgiven
unless the torture of the fast was added to that of early
rising, travel, prostration before the altar and listening to
pious palaver.</p>

<p>I stand it for my children's sake. They will be returned
to me after I did penance full score. My only satisfaction:
I compel the Tisch to attend me on my trips, and make her
sit on the back seat of the carriage. I know this turns her
stomach and watch her twitching face with devilish glee.</p>

</p>

<p>With the authority of the pregnant woman I demanded
that I be allowed to return to town.</p>

<p>"If compelled to see Prince George and the rest of my
enemies daily, my child will be mal-formed, or I will
suffer an <i>avortement</i>," I told the King.</p>

<p>They let me go and I am breathing more freely. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
still wear the chain and ball, but they don't cut into my
flesh as in Pillnitz.</p>

<p>Yesterday I learned that Bernhardt was in Dresden,
and sent for him. He came in company of two army
officers who remained in the anteroom.</p>

<p>"I am a prisoner," he said resignedly, "those fellows
outside will conduct me to Nossen."</p>

<p>The audience granted him several months ago took
place only after my departure from the summer residence,
and developed into a fearful scene.</p>

<p>"His Majesty," said Bernhardt, "was in a rage when
I entered. 'State what you have to say,' said the King,
'and be brief.'</p>

<p>"'If Your Majesty will graciously permit me to reside
in Dresden, I will promise to lead a life in accordance
with Your Majesty's intentions and will obey your slightest
wish.'</p>

<p>"'What?' cried the King, 'You dare name conditions
for your good conduct?'"</p>

<p>Bernhardt denied any intention to impose conditions,
but begged to submit to His Majesty that he couldn't exist
in those small garrisons. If in Dresden, it would come
easier to him to turn over a new leaf.</p>

<p>"Sure, all you young rakes want to live in the capital,"
sneered the King, "because it's easy in a big town to hide
one's delinquencies."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Majesty," cried Bernhardt, "if I ever did a
reprehensible thing, it was forced upon me by intolerable
conditions."</p>

<p>The King grew white with rage.</p>

<p>"No excuses," he thundered. "You are a rip and ugly
customer and you will stay in the garrison I designated."</p>

<p>Even before the King had finished, Bernhardt interrupted
him with a fierce: "Don't you call me names,
Majesty. I won't stand for that."</p>

<p>"Won't stand for anything that I think proper to mete
out to you, rascal? I will make you." The King had risen
and was about to box Bernhardt's ears.</p>

<p>Bernhardt jumped back two paces and shouted like
mad: "Don't you dare touch me. I will defend my honor
sword in hand, even if I have to shoot myself on the spot."</p>

<p>For several seconds the King stood speechless, then
he reached out his hand and touched an electric button.
Marshal Count Vitzthum responded.</p>

<p>"Take him," said the King hoarsely&mdash;"he is your
prisoner."</p>

<p>Bernhardt drew his sword and threw it at the King's
feet. He was conducted to a room, and sentinels were
posted outside his door and under his windows. Presently
the telephone called together a council of war and it was
decided that Bernhardt go to Nossen during the King's
pleasure, or rather displeasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"The army officers that act as my guards are not
allowed to speak to me," said Bernhardt, "and the garrison
in Nossen will likewise be muzzled." He laughed as he
added: "I suppose I shall have to make friends with the
spirits of the great Augustus's mistresses haunting the old
burg. They were gay ones! If the King remembered that,
he would send me to the Trappists rather than to Nossen."</p>

</p>

<p>I never dreamt that science would come to my rescue,
but a clever woman has more than one trick up her sleeve.
On a visit to a book store I happened to see a new publication
on the Hygienics of Pregnancy and had it sent to the
palace.</p>

<p>Last night, when nearly dead with <i>ennui</i>, I turned over
the leaves of the volume and came across an article advising
women in my condition to seek plenty of merry company.
My mind was made up at once.</p>

<p>First thing in the morning I sent for the Court Physician,
and with many a sigh and groan gave him to understand
that I feared to have melancholy if I continued the
monotonous life I was leading.</p>

<p>I happened to strike one of the doctor's pet theories,
and he recited whole pages from the book I had been reading.
Then he asked me a hundred questions, and rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
assured that my answers were in accordance with my
wishes.</p>

<p>"I will have the honor to report to His Majesty at
once," said the Councillor at the end of the examination,
"that some diversion is imperative in Your Imperial Highness's
case. Would Your Imperial Highness be pleased
to visit the theatre or the Opera if the King approves?"</p>

<p>The King did approve, and the Crown Princess of
Saxony is once more permitted the privilege of <i>Frau</i>
Schmidt and <i>Frau</i> M&uuml;ller; namely, to go to the theatre
when she feels like it.</p>

protests because I won't stand for insult from Emperor&mdash;I
give rein to my contempt for his family&mdash;Hypocrites,

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>November 2, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Great family concourse to look my new baby over,
dear Marie Alix, born at Wachwitz, September 27.</p>

<p>Emperor Francis Joseph was first to arrive, the Majesty
who is forever posing as the family's good genius, as
upholder of peace and amity among his countless cousins
and nieces, and the many uncles and aunts and other
relatives of his grand-children.</p>

<p>Behold how he lived up to this reputation!</p>

<p>I had been commanded to attend the reception in the
Queen's <i>salon</i>, and made my bow to him. He bowed all
around, looking at each present, but managed to overlook
me.</p>

<p>Then he commenced a long and weary conversation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
with the Queen, at whose elbow I sat, and when his stock
of platitudes was exhausted, turned to fat Mathilde, congratulating
her on the possession of the <i>Stern Kreuz</i>
decoration, an Austrian order which I likewise wore at
my corsage. It was none other than the late Empress
Elizabeth who pinned it on me.</p>

<p>Presently dinner was announced. The Emperor took
in Her Majesty, the King, <i>nolens, volens</i>, had to conduct
me, but gave me neither word nor look. Nor did the others.
I couldn't have been more isolated on a desert island, than
at this royal board.</p>

<p>They talked and cracked their silly jokes, and paid
compliments to each other and were careful not to let their
tongues run away with their intriguing minds, but all went
above my head. No one spoke to me but the lackeys: "If
it please Your Imperial Highness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus tore into my bedroom some little
time after I had retired. Picture of the offended gentleman,
if you please. I got no more than I deserve, but it
"reflected on him, h-i-m, HIM." Though it was a "family
dinner," he, the Crown Prince of Saxony, was "publicly" disgraced.
The Emperor had treated the Crown Princess as
air. He had not deigned to address a single word to her.
The Crown Princess was a trollop in the Imperial eyes&mdash;it
was enough to drive the Crown Prince to drink.</p>

<p>"Drink yourself to death then," I shrieked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>During the night I speculated what to do: ask a private
audience of the Emperor, state my side of the case and
beg his forgiveness and protection, beg, especially, for better
treatment at his hands?</p>

<p>And if he refused?</p>

<p>Francis Joseph is a good deal of a Jesuit. When he
hates, he never lets it come to a break; when he loves,
he never attaches himself.</p>

<p>If I stooped to humiliate myself, he might choose to
debase me still more. It was entirely probable that he
would betray my confidences to the King and Prince George.</p>

<p>I will defy him and&mdash;all of them!</p>

<p>"Her Imperial Highness regrets&mdash;&mdash;" my Court Marshal
wrote in answer to all invitations or rather "commands"
for the next three days. When I refused to participate
in the "grand leave-taking," Frederick Augustus
came post-haste to expostulate with me.</p>

<p>"You must. It would be an affront without precedent."</p>

<p>"Take leave of a man who didn't say good-day to me
on his arrival, and who probably intends to slight me in
similar fashion on going away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>In lieu of argument the Prince Royal abused me like
a pick-pocket; I had waited for it and now I let loose.</p>

<p>"You are like the rest of your family," I shouted:
"ignorant, thoughtless, brutal <i>en venerie</i>, sanctimonious in
dotage. I know few people for whom I have so great a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
detestation as for the Royal Saxons. Look at your father,
there is no more jesuitical a Jesuit, the inward man as
hideous as the outward. He would be an insolent lackey,
if he didn't happen to be a prince.</p>

<p>"And Johann George&mdash;a shameless inheritance-chaser,
despoiler of pupillary funds, gambler at the <i>bourse</i>, who
whines like a whipped dog when he loses.</p>

<p>"The royal Bernhardt, companion of street-walkers!</p>

<p>"Prince Max, who talks theology, but keeps his eye on
Therese.</p>

<p>"Your Queen, a victim of religious madness, your King
and his system&mdash;organized selfishness. Chicanery for those
dependent upon him, ruin for all more gifted than the
average Wettiner.</p>

<p>"While living here I have learned to look upon my
father's discrowning as a stroke of good luck for, since
kings can no longer indulge their brutalities against their
subjects, they turned tyrants at home.</p>

<p>"If your father did to the humblest of his subjects
what he did to me, he would be chased from home and
country. The people, the parliament, his own creatures
would rise against him and blot his name from the royal
roster.</p>

<p>"In the palace, in boudoirs, in the nurseries, he plays
the prince&mdash;extortioner&mdash;executioner. To the public he is
the benign lord, whining for paltry huzzas."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Frederick Augustus was so dumfounded, he could only
grind his teeth.</p>

<p>I continued: "You prate of respect due the Majesty.
There's nothing to induce feelings of that sort. Round
me there is naught but weakness, hypocrisy, pettiness. I
see shame and thievery stalking side by side in these gilded
halls&mdash;gilded for show, but pregnant with woe.</p>

<p>"Fie on you, Prince Royal, who allows his wife to be
dogged by spies. Thieves, paid by your father, steal my
souvenirs; a burglar's kit hidden in their clothes, they
besiege my writing table. Jailers stand between me and
my children.</p>

<p>"My children!</p>

<p>"Like a she-dog,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> whose young were drowned, I cry
for my babies&mdash;I, the Crown Princess of Saxony, who saved
your family from dying out, a degenerate, depraved, demoralized,
decadent race."</p>

<p>When I had said this and more I fell down and was
seized by crying convulsions.</p>

<p>Patience ceased to be a virtue. Tolerance would be
a crime against myself. I am determined to do as I please
in future. If it upsets the King's, Prince George's and
the rest's delicate digestion, so much the better.</p>

<p>The newspapers are hinting about my troubles with
Prince George and the King. When I go driving or appear
at the theatre, the public shows its sympathy in many ways.
Sometimes I am acclaimed to the echo.</p>

<p>Mamma wrote me a tearful letter. She spent six hours
in prayers for "sinful Louise" and sends me the fruits
of her meditations: six pages of close script, advising me
how to regain the King's and Prince George's favor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>Never before have I failed in outward respect to my
mother, but this time I wrote to her: "Pray attend to your
own affairs. Don't meddle in mine which you are entirely
unable to understand."</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>November 6, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Bernhardt was sent to Sonnenstein. Whether he became
insane at Nossen, or whether it is the family's intention
to drive him mad among the madmen of Sonnenstein, I
don't know, but it behooves me to be careful.</p>

<p>Sonnenstein has accommodation for both sexes.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>November 15, 1901</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I sent a letter to the King, asking him to have Loschwitz
Castle prepared for my reception. His Majesty didn't
deign to answer, but Prince George commanded me in
writing to stay at Dresden "under his watchful eye."</p>

<p>I immediately proceeded to his apartments in my morning
undress, without hat, gloves or wrap. As I rushed
through the anteroom, Adjutant von Metsch begged me
with up-lifted hands not to force His Royal Highness's
door, Prince George being too ill to receive me, etc., etc.
I paid no attention to his mournful whinings. At that
moment I had courage enough to stock a regiment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you won't allow me to go to Loschwitz," I addressed
George as I suddenly bobbed up at the side of his desk.</p>

<p>My father-in-law looked at me as if I were a spook,
emerged from a locked closet.</p>

<p>"Who let you in?" he managed to say after a while.</p>

<p>"I didn't come here to answer questions," I replied.
"I came to announce that if you don't let me go to Loschwitz,
there will be a scandal that will resound all over
Christendom and make you impossible in your own capital."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to leave Dresden?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"Because I want to be alone. Because I am tired of
hateful faces. Because I refuse to accept orders and insults
from people that are beneath an Imperial Princess of
Austria."</p>

<p>Prince George turned pale.</p>

<p>"Am I one of those beneath Your Imperial Highness?"
he queried stupidly.</p>

<p>"Decidedly so."</p>

<p>A long pause. Then Prince George shouted: "To the
devil with you. I don't care whether you stay in Loschwitz,
or Dresden, or on the Vogelwiese."</p>

<p>The Vogelwiese is an amusement park, respectable
enough, but the word or name, as used by George, reeked
with sinister and insulting meaning.</p>

<p>Trembling with rage, I replied: "Right royal language
you royal Saxons use. From time to time, I suppose, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
refresh your fish-wife vocabulary in the annals of Augustus
the Physical Strong, than whom a more gross word-slinger
did not walk the history of the eighteenth century."</p>

<p>I believe Prince George was frightened by my violence.
Assuming a haughty tone he said formally: "Your
Imperial Highness is at liberty to travel whenever you
please, but you will be so good as to leave your children
in Dresden."</p>

<p>I stepped up to the white-livered coward and hissed
in his face: "Steal my children if you dare, and I will go
to France, or Switzerland and ask a republican President
to interfere for humanity's sake."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;land yourself in an insane asylum," sneered
George.</p>

<p>"An old trick of the Royal House of Saxony, I know,"
I shouted back. "Bernhardt is saner than you, yet the King
sent him to Sonnenstein. If such a crime had been perpetrated
by one not a king, he would go to jail."</p>

<p>Prince George pointed a trembling finger towards the
door. "Out with you!" he bawled hoarsely. "Out!"</p>

<p>I stood my ground. "May I take my children? Yes
or no?"</p>

<p>He rang the bell and repeated mechanically: "Out with
you, out!"</p>

<p>I had another fit of crying convulsions. Doctors, maids
and lackeys were summoned in numbers. They bedded me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
on the couch and six men-servants carried me to my apartments.</p>

<p>Two days later I went to Loschwitz with my children.</p>

<p>I had defied the King. Prince George was humbled.
I carried my point, and the Dresden court will not see me
again in a hurry.</p>

</p>

<p>I refused to spend Christmas at Court. Frederick
Augustus planned a stay of a couple of weeks. "Not a
single night," I wrote back.</p>

<p>They parleyed; they begged. "The Crown Prince
desires to spend Christmas with the children. In the
interests of public opinion, it's absolutely necessary that he
does."</p>

<p>"But not&mdash;that I submit to prostitution. I will give
him a dinner, but he will drive back to Dresden immediately
afterwards."</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus brought numerous presents for me.
"You may place them under the Christmas tree," I ordered
the Tisch.</p>

<p>"Oh, Your Imperial Highness, look," cried the Tisch,
holding up something or other.</p>

<p>I turned my back on her and looked out of the window.
I never went near my end of the Christmas table. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
will send the things brought by His Royal Highness to
the bazaar for crippled children," I told the House Marshal.
"They shall be sold for the benefit of the poor."</p>

</p>

<p>"Her Imperial Highness regrets."</p>

<p>I refused the invitations to today's family dinner; the
grand reception, <i>Te Deum</i> and parade. "Unprecedented
affront!" What do I care!</p>

<p>I have eighteen horses, half-a-dozen carriages, I drive,
I ride, I hunt, I give the Tisch palpitation daily by the
literature I affect: <i>Zola</i>, <i>Flaubert</i>, <i>M'lle Paul</i>, <i>Ma Femme</i>,
<i>M'lle de Maupin</i>, <i>Casanova</i>, <i>M'me Bovary</i>. And the periodicals
I subscribed for! <i>Simplicissimus</i>, Harden's <i>Zukunft</i>,
all the <i>double entendre</i> weeklies and monthlies of Paris.
May Prince George and Mathilde burst with rage and envy
when they hear of my excursions in the realms of the literary
Satans.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 37em;">Loschwitz</span>, <i>January 15, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>The Tisch is beginning to treat me like a person irresponsible
for her doings. Sonnenstein is looming up anew.
But I am going to fool her. As I will hold no more speech
with her, there will be no occasion for turning my own
words against me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>If I have to give a command, or answer a question,
I ask Lucretia or <i>Fr&auml;ulein</i> von Schoenberg to convey my
orders.</p>

<p>An uneventful winter is drawing to a close. By banishing
myself to this quiet place I raised a barrier against
quarrels, against harsh orders, against humiliations. And
the barrier also shuts out: love, happiness.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the Tisch's hateful mouth spouts
honeyed platitudes, I ask myself whether the affair with
Henry wasn't, after all, a flower-covered pit dug for me
by my enemies.</p>

<p>It was the Tisch who had Henry appointed <i>Vort&auml;nzer</i>.</p>

<p>Maybe, knowing my inflammable heart, she offered the
tempting bait solely to the end of getting me into her
power?</p>

<p>Far from impossible.</p>

<p>I curse the day when I entered Dresden, joined this
court and family.</p>

<p>Royal command to join the court at Pillnitz June 1.
The King, who has been ailing for some time, is anxious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
to be reunited with the children, and, as a necessary evil,
I must go along.</p>

<p>I replied that I would prefer Nossen, or even Stolpen,
if it pleases His Majesty.</p>

<p>Castle Stolpen is an old-time stronghold of the bishops
of Meissen, and its very ruins are pregnant with reminiscences
of a barbaric age. The apartments once occupied
by the Countess Cosel, as a prison first, as a residence
after the death of Augustus, might be made habitable even
now. Exceedingly interesting are the old-time torture
chambers and the subterranean living rooms of the
"sworn torturer" and the dogs, man-shaped, that served
him.</p>

<p>Sanct. Donatus Tower, a wing of the great, black pile,
was the ancient <i>habitat</i> of these worthies, and the torture
chamber, still extant, is a hall almost as big as the Dresden
throne-room. In an inscription hewn in the basalt, the
sovereign bishop, Johannes VI, poses as builder and seems
proud of the damnable fact. Other princes of the Church
let us know in high-sounding Latin script that they created
the "Monk hole" and the "stairless prison" respectively.</p>

<p>The latter is a vast subterranean vault, never reached
by sunshine or light of any kind. Its victims were made
to descend some twenty feet below the surface of the earth
on a ladder. When near the bottom, the ladder was pulled
up and&mdash;stayed up. The prisoners were fed once every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
twenty-four hours, when a leather water pouch and some
pounds of black bread were sent down on a rope.</p>

<p>Of course only the strongest got a morsel, or a drink
of water. The others died of starvation and the survivors
lived only until there were new arrivals, stronger than
themselves. The dead bodies were never removed, and
horrible stories of necrophily smudge the records of this
awful prison and cover its princely keepers with infamy.</p>

<p>The "Monk's hole" was called officially "Obey Your
Judge." It is a sort of chimney, just large enough to take
the body of a man.</p>

<p>When a monk or other prisoner refused to confess,
he was let down into the hole in the wall to starve, while
tempting dishes, meat, wine and bread, were dangled over
his head, almost within reach of his hands.</p>

<p>Of course, after enduring this torture for several days,
the delinquent was glad enough to "Obey His Judge."</p>

<p>By offering to go to this abode of horror and to take
the place of Cosel, I meant to show my utter contempt
for the royal favor vouchsafed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>King Albert is dead. George is King, and may God
have mercy upon my soul.</p>

<p>Of course the demise of His Majesty changed all my
plans of defiance and otherwise. I am once more an official
person, even an important one, for the new King can't last
long. He is a very sick man, in fact. Perhaps that is the
reason why he wants to hear himself addressed "Your
Majesty" all the time. Petty souls like to be called "great."</p>

</p>

<p>I intended to return at once to Loschwitz, but the King,
hearing of my intention and not wishing to provoke another
scene, invited my father to come to Dresden "in the interests
of his daughter."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>The same evening I received a wire from papa, saying
that he would be in Dresden within twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>My own arrival in the capital was kept secret by the
King's order, but next afternoon, when I drove to the
station to welcome my father, I got my reception just the
same. The people wildly cheered their Crown Princess
and thousands of sympathizing eyes followed me from the
palace to the depot.</p>

<p>I was almost overcome by so much sympathy and when
at last I saw father, I threw myself on his neck, crying
aloud.</p>

<p>The King was standing by, impatiently waiting to conduct
his grand-ducal guest before the guard of honor had drawn
up. "Later, later," whispered papa, patting me on the
cheek.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>June 22, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I had an hour's talk with father. I bared my heart
to him. I reported my own faults along with those of the
others.</p>

<p>Papa understands me. He sympathizes with me, but
help me he cannot.</p>

<p>"These are only passing shadows," he said. "Look
boldly into the future. You will soon be Queen."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>And he told me of his financial difficulties and of the
misfortune of being a sovereign lord without either land
or money.</p>

<p>"The Emperor ordered me to scold you hard," he continued,
"and mamma wants me to be very severe. As to
King George, he said he would thank God if I succeeded
in breaking your rebellious spirit. 'If you don't, I will,'
added his Majesty."</p>

<p>Then father kissed me more lovingly than ever and
asked, half apologetically: "Is it true, Louise, that you
had a lover?"</p>

<p>"I thought I had one, but he was unworthy of me,"
I replied without shame.</p>

<p>My confession seemed to frighten him.</p>

<p>"It's sad, sad," he said. "Royal blood is dangerous
juice. It brought Mary of Scots to the scaffold; it caused
your great-aunt Marie Antoinette to lose her head, only
to save the old monarchies a few years later, when we
inveigled the enemy of legitimate kingship into a marriage
with another of your relatives. But for Marie, Louise, the
descendants of the Corsican might still sit on a dozen
thrones."</p>

<p>Father forgot his daughter's disgrace when he mounted
this historic hobby-horse and, needless to say, I did not
recall the original text.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>Only when, three days later, he took leave of me,
holding my head long between his two trembling hands
and kissing me again and again, I felt that the poor, old
man's heart was oppressed with shame and torn by fears.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>King George is determined I shall stay in Dresden
to end the newspaper talk about trouble in the bosom of
the royal family.</p>

<p>He engaged a new head-tutor for my little brood.
Monsieur Giron, a Belgian of good family.</p>

<p>"I would be pleased if you attended the children's
lessons and reported to me on the method of the new man,"
he said. "You are so intellectual, Louise, you will find
out quickly if M. Giron is not what he is represented
to be."</p>

<p>I promised, for, after all, I owed so much to the King
and my children.</p>

<p>Alas, it was fate!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p><hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 36em;">Dresden</span>, <i>July 1, After Midnight</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>He is tall, well made, and his wild, Grecian eyes fascinate
me. He is conscious of self, but modest. His voice
is sweet and sonorous, his eyes are bright with intellect.
Speaking eyes!</p>

<p>I asked him to visit my apartments at the conclusion
of school hours. He told me he was a painter as well as
a teacher of languages.</p>

<p>"Would you like to paint me?"</p>

<p>"I am dying for a chance to reproduce your loveliness
as far as my poor art permits."</p>

<p>He told me he had a studio in town, where he is known
under his artist's <i>pseudonyme</i>, Richard.</p>

<p>"How romantic! I'd like to see it," I said impulsively.</p>

<p>"Several ladies and gentlemen of society sat for portraits
at my studio here and at home."</p>

<p>In short we arranged that he paint my picture and
that I should go to his studio, where the light is excellent.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>July 15, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>I am happy once more. Those hours at Richard's
studio are the sweetest of my life.</p>

<p>Lucretia acts the protecting angel as usual. Richard
calls her Justice because she is "blind." When she is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
along, I drive boldly up to the door in one of the court
carriages. Sometimes, when I can sneak out of the palace
for a little while unobserved, I go alone in a cab.</p>

<p>How long this sort of thing can go on without discovery,
I know not. As to what will happen afterwards,
I care not.</p>

<p>If I was told that tomorrow I would be caught in my
lover's arms and banished to a lone island for life, I would
go to his studio just the same.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>August 1, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Richard is moulding my character. I, once so proud
of rank and station, I, who upheld the Wettiners' robbery
of a poor, defenseless woman, the Duke's wife, because
Socialistic papers spoke in her favor,&mdash;Louise now allows
anarchistic tendencies to be poured in her ears. She almost
applauds them.</p>

<p>This easy change from one extreme to the other at a
lover's behest is one of the things that make woman's rule&mdash;or
co-rule&mdash;as the male's political equal&mdash;impossible. It's
a sort of <i>Phallus</i> worship that always was and always
will be.</p>

<p>"Though women have not unfrequently been the holders
of temporary and precarious power, there are not many
instances where they have held secure and absolute domin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>ion,"
says Dr. William W. Ireland in his famous "Blot
upon the Brain."</p>

<p>Because they were swayed by the male of the species,
of course!</p>

<p>Though the characters of the world's female sovereigns
differed as to blood, race, education, environment
and personal traits, neither showed any inclination to resist
the allurements of irregular <i>amours</i>.</p>

<p>Think of Semiramis, of Mary of Scots, of Elizabeth,
Catherine I, of the Tsaritzas Elizabeth and the second
Catherine&mdash;under the temptations of Power, they recruited
paramours for themselves in all ranks of society.</p>

<p>Agrippina was more licentious than Caligula; Messalina's
infamy surpassed Nero's, and the furthest reaching,
the one irresistible Power swaying them all was MAN.</p>

<p>Augustus of the three hundred and fifty-four emphasized
this in the negative and, in his own uncouth way, by "postering"
the Countess Cosel's chief charm on penny coins.</p>

<p>"She cost Saxony twenty millions in gold&mdash;behold the
penny's worth she gave in return."</p>

<p>When the beauty who had brought the richest German
kingdom to the verge of state bankruptcy died February 2,
1765, four hundred of Augustus's infamous medals were
found hidden in her favorite armchair. She paid three or
four times their weight in gold for each.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>August 10, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>This is the kind of speech Richard holds with me and&mdash;I
enjoy:</p>

<p>"Every working-girl, every poor woman who suckles
her own children and helps her husband in the fight for existence,
stands mountain high above royal ladies like you.</p>

<p>"None of you royal ladies are their moral equals.</p>

<p>"In no distant time," he says, "they will chase you from
your thrones, even as your relatives had to evacuate France
by tumbril, post-chaise or train."</p>

<p>Richard's ethical and intellectual valuation of royal
princes coincides with my own. He has rare insight into
our family life.</p>

<p>However, these disclosures both amazed and alarmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
me when I first heard them pronounced. I never dreamt
that opinions of that kind prevailed among the masses.</p>

<p>"But why am I acclaimed whenever I show myself?"</p>

<p>"Because you are pretty, because you impersonate the
one thing all are desirous to embrace: affluence, kindness,
youth and beauty. Because you are a treat to the senses
and because sensuality is the paramount thing in life,
whether we admit it or not."</p>

<p>"Who's 'we'?"</p>

<p>"Kings and anarchists, princesses of the Blood and laundresses,
royal princes and cab drivers, empresses, street-walkers,
society ladies, big-wigs and <i>sabretasches</i>. The
draggled Menads and the helpful Lafayette, the Jacobins,
Charlotte Corday and the man she killed&mdash;all were, and are,
on similar pleasure bent."</p>

<p>And he added quickly: "As to the Dresdeners, they
are tickled because, every time they applaud you, the King
is scandalized."</p>

<p>"How do they know that I am not on good terms with
the King?"</p>

<p>"The very children in arms understand."</p>

<p>All Dresden, says Richard, is talking about me. Everybody
assumes to know the number and qualities of my lovers.
"Louise," they argue, "knows how to enjoy herself, but,
though it serves the King right, we wouldn't have her for a
daughter-in-law, either."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>According to the masses, I visit the Vogelwiese at
night, ride on the flying horses and solicit men and boys that
please my fancy. Like a gigantic she-monster, I drag them
to my lair&mdash;"some to vanish forever." (No doubt, I eat
them.)</p>

<p>"Unwashed soldiers and clerks reeking with cheap
perfume, actors and students, draymen and generals, it's all
the same to the Crown Princess.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, when the spirit moves her, the Crown Princess
issues from her gilded apartments in the palace and
seizes the sentinel patrolling the corridors. Or she visits
the guard-room <i>en d&eacute;shabille</i> and selects the youngest and
best looking officer for her prey.</p>

<p>"Generous, too. She thinks nothing of handing a pension
of ten thousand marks per year to a chap that pleased
her once."</p>

<p>"Is that all they say about me?"</p>

<p>"Not one-half. Poor devils that can't afford ten marks
per year for their fun, Cit's wives that know only their ill-kempt
husbands, factory girls that sell their virtue for a
supper or a glass of beer&mdash;though afterwards they claim
it was champagne&mdash;all take delight in contemplating that
you, or any other good looking royal woman, are Frankenstein's
succuba or worse. Didn't they accuse your grand-aunt,
Marie Antoinette, of incest with her son and gave
him to the cobbler to thrash the immorality out of him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>"And they give names?"</p>

<p>"Strings of them"&mdash;among them several I never heard
mentioned before.</p>

<p>Richard is jealous&mdash;jealous of the men I did love and
the regiments that public opinion give me credit for. He
must needs think I have loins of steel.</p>

<p>He tells me he suffers agonies by what I confessed,
and still more by what I hide. To see him thus unhappy
gives me intense pleasure, for it shows that the boy loves
me to distraction.</p>

<p>M. Giron was very cold and distant during the afternoon's
lessons.</p>

<p>I had previously lunched with him at his studio and
we were very gay then. I teased him unmercifully about
"his royal <i>demi-mondaine</i>," as the masses painted me.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus was very gallant at dinner and told
me, before a table full of people, that he would take pleasure
in sleeping with me tonight. I have too bad a conscience
to deny myself to him. But I ran over to the opera for half
an hour and ordered M. Giron to my box.</p>

<p>"I got over my vexation," he said,&mdash;"got over it because
I reflected that you are the Princess Royal and that I would
be a fool to take your love seriously. Henceforth I will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
regard it a passing adventure and let it go at that, for if I
thought it the great passion of my life, I would despair,
indeed."</p>

<p>"Find a closed cab," I whispered, my heart in my mouth;
"I must see you alone. I will be at the northern side-exit
in five minutes."</p>

<p>Cabby was ordered to drive slowly along unfrequented
side streets. We lowered the curtains.</p>

<p>"So you don't love me?" I wailed. Burying my face on
Richard's chest I cried as if my heart would break.</p>

<p>"Not love you?" he breathed. "If I loved you not, I
would die, Louise."</p>

<p>"Then why those cruel words?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens," he cried, "haven't I the right to be
jealous? I said what I said to hear you say that you love
me."</p>

<p>"And you will always love me?"</p>

<p>"Always, dearest," and he covered my face and neck
with burning kisses.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later I was again seated at the opera.</p>

<p>I hear Frederick Augustus in the corridor.</p>

more than half drunk when he sought "His Imperial Pleas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>ure-trove,"
as he likes to call me, for I often talk in my
sleep and&mdash;I dreamt of Richard. I dreamt of my enemies,
too.</p>

<p>They stole him from me. He was of the past like
Henry, Romano and the rest.</p>

<p>In a second dream he jilted me&mdash;cast me off like a
garment, old or out of fashion.</p>

<p>Lucretia, who sleeps in the next room, heard me cry
out in terror, heard me denounce the King, Tisch&mdash;everybody.</p>

<p>And Frederick Augustus snored.</p>

<p>Princes and noblemen have ever sought their own advantage
of me. To them I was always the milch-cow, or
Phryne, outright.</p>

<p>Richard is poor. I offered him a considerable sum for
one of his paintings.</p>

<p>"Never again mention the matter," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"But it would give me much pleasure to be of assistance
to you."</p>

talk," he replied.</p>

<p>A day or two later I let fall, casually, that Frederick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
Augustus might buy the portrait of myself that was nearing
completion under his skillful brush.</p>

<p>That dreadful dream is becoming a heart-breaking
reality.</p>

<p>The Tisch entered my boudoir last night in her mantilla,
emblem of her office as Grand Mistress.</p>

<p>Some dirty business on hand, I surmised at once.</p>

<p>"Imperial Highness," she said, genuflexing ceremoniously,
"I submit that your artist takes too long about the
portrait. Your Imperial Highness's visits to the studio must
cease."</p>

<p>"Since when do you give orders here, Baroness?"</p>

<p>"His Majesty empowered me," answered the Grand
Dame.</p>

<p>"In that case, do as you like, but don't bother me," I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
cried bravely enough, but trembling in every limb. The
Tisch, no doubt, is preparing to deal me another blow.</p>

<p>When I told Richard that henceforth we would have to
exercise extra care, he was beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>"Why stand such tyranny?" he cried. "No self-respecting
woman, other than royal, would submit for a single week
to be bullied and intrigued against and threatened and browbeaten
as you are, and they have ill-used you for eleven
years. If you were a simple Cit's daughter, instead of the
descendant of a decrepit, bloodless family, yclept royal, you
would make an end now, leave them to their shabby kingship
and be a free woman&mdash;free and happy."</p>

<p>My lover forgets the children, but the picture of the
free life he draws is most attractive.</p>

<p>"And would you go with me to the end of the earth, as
the story books put it?" I asked tremblingly.</p>

strong enough to throw away a crown, I will be your slave
for life."</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Highness was pleased to call me a thief
once," said the Tisch early this morning as she entered my
boudoir, triumph written all over her yellow countenance.
"You repeated that calumny to the Prince Royal and doubt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>less
to many other persons. Today came the opportunity
to live up to my reputation. I stole a letter addressed to you

<p>The blow made my knees tremble, but pain and rage
came to my assistance, effacing the momentary weakness.</p>

<p>"Don't think for a moment to frighten me," I cried. "I
say to your face that I have a lover&mdash;a gentleman, not an
unspeakable, like your nephew. And now listen: I will
tell the King and the press of Europe, if it must be, that
it was you, my Grand Mistress, who 'pandered' me to Henry&mdash;for&mdash;revenue.
I will have him whipped out of the
army&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't suppose for a moment that the word of an
adulteress would prove acceptable either to His Majesty or
anyone else?" hissed the insolent creature.</p>

<p>"My word will be accepted all around," I shouted back,
"for I have the proofs, proofs that you smuggled this unspeakable
into my household, proofs that you lied to the
King in order not to disrupt your nephew's career.</p>

<p>"And I will cry from the house-tops that you discovered
my relations with Henry only <i>after</i> I had paid his
debts, <i>after</i> I had financed his excursions to gambling-houses
and to usurers' dens. Ah, I paid his tailors and glove-makers,
his board and lodging, his laundry bills. I paid the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
alimony due his strumpets, and <i>after</i> all was done, <i>after</i> his
lieutenantship had again a clean bill of health, financially
speaking, then, and not a moment before, did you step in
and make an end of the farce, wherein I played the part of
'angel,' or pay-master."</p>

<p>The Tisch got visibly smaller under my lash. The air
of triumph she bore when entering the room gave way to
an expression of despair. If she hadn't sent the letter to the
King, I believe she would have given it up after I was half
through with her.</p>

<p>Once more I hold the whip hand, but what good will
it do me since I am condemned to lose the man I love?</p>

<p>Richard approved of all I said and did. We were unspeakably
happy this afternoon, despite the storm threatening
us.</p>

<p>I fear neither the King nor Frederick Augustus now,
but the fear of Sonnenstein I can't shake off.</p>

<p>If the King takes it upon himself to say that I'm mad,
there will be plenty of medical authorities to bear him out,
none to oppose him.</p>

<p>Of course, they will separate me from my children and
will do their utmost to drive me mad between now and the
time when I should be proclaimed Queen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<h4>A MAD HOUSE FOR LOUISE&mdash;PROBABLY</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My confidential maid, Lucretia, is banished&mdash;The new King has
got the incriminating letter, but Frederick Augustus says
nothing&mdash;On the eve of judgment the King falls ill.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>October 21, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>This morning, at six, Lucretia rushed into my room.
She was in her night-gown. Her hair was loose. No color
in her face.</p>

<p>And between sobs and curses she told me that she had
orders to leave by ten sharp. "If you dare stay over the
appointed time, you will be transported to the frontier on
foot, between gendarmes."</p>

<p>"Von Baumann shall come."</p>

<p>I threw a loose wrapper over my night-gown and
received him at once.</p>

<p>"My marriage contract provides that no one but I have
the right of dismissal with respect to Countess Baranello,"
I said sharply.</p>

<p>"As long as the lady keeps within the law," replied
Baumann with just a trace of insolence in his voice.</p>

<p>I looked at him in astonishment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Countess is guilty of a crime, of a succession of
crimes," continued Baumann, "but His Majesty, not wishing
to be harsh, decided to treat her merely as an obnoxious
foreigner. She has forfeited her right to live in Saxony,
and will do well to obey."</p>

<p>I helped poor Lucretia pack. I gave her a handful of
jewels, I paid her a year's salary in advance and ordered
the treasury to procure first-class passage for her to Rome.</p>

<p>I sent her to the station in my own carriage, and wired
to our Rome representative to show her every courtesy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 44em;"><i>Afternoon.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus hasn't said a word to me about the
affair with Richard. We have our meals together and his
attitude in no wise differs from that usually maintained.
Yet I am convinced he knows.</p>

<p>The last service rendered me by Lucretia, gave me
great relief. She found out that neither the Tisch, nor
Frederick Augustus, nor the King know who "Richard" is.
Fortunately his letter was typewritten, signature and all.</p>

</p>

<p>He is dangerously ill. It may be weeks and months before
the King recovers&mdash;if he recovers at all.</p>

<p>I feel like praying, crying, shouting with joy.</p>

<p>When Richard folded his arms about me this afternoon,
I said to myself: "God doesn't begrudge me a lover as
kind and good as Richard."</p>

<p>The King's illness has disorganized the espionage, my
coming and going are no longer controlled. The body-groom
brings in my letters as delivered at the gate.</p>

<p>In the school room, while the children are writing or
studying, Richard and I find time to exchange kind words
and even an occasional caress. When I "command" the
tutor to my apartments, we need fear no surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>The utmost quiet prevails in the palace. The courtyard
is sanded foot high and strewn with straw to deaden the
sound of wheels and horses' hoofs. No more mounting of
the guard with fife and drum.</p>

<p>I suggested that the children be sent to the <i>Grosser
Garten</i> to play. The Tisch agreed with enthusiasm. This
yields us&mdash;Richard and myself&mdash;two hours of love-making.</p>

<p>The King continues ill.</p>

<p>I went into a cheap jeweler's this afternoon and bought
an inexpensive ring with a ruby no larger than a pin head.
When I gave it to Richard, he grew red with joy.</p>

<p>Strange, he bought a similar ring for me. I shall never
wear another ring in my life but Richard's. I pulled my
rings off one after the other and threw them on the bed.</p>

<p>I kissed the larger ring and "wished" it on Richard's
finger. He did the same with the ring intended for me.
And we said, as with a common breath, "Our wedding."</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>November 1, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>A bulletin, by the King's physicians, holds out scant
hopes for George's life.</p>

<p>I am watching the palace yard. The Archbishop of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Dresden, attended by two court chaplains and a host of other
clerics, is just mounting the stairs to administer the last
rites of the Church. The next minute may see me Queen
of Saxony. I may even be Queen now. I wish I had the
effrontery to promise the lackey or official, announcing my
enthronization, a handful of gold, as George did, when
King Albert was dying.</p>

<p>Even so, I have risen immeasurably in everybody's
esteem. The sweet family knows me again. Johann George,
Mathilde, Isabelle and Max are kotowing to me. Bernhardt
sent me a telegram of condolence&mdash;condolence! He is a
humorist, that boy.</p>

<p>Minister of the Royal House, Baron Seydwitz, called
twice. The Royal Adjutant, General von Carlowitz, spoke
of the possibility of giving Bernhardt a command in Dresden.
Von Baumann says it was the President of the Police
who insisted upon Lucretia's hasty departure. If he, Baumann,
had his way, my maid of honor would have got off
with a warning.</p>

<p>And you should see the Tisch. She must have spent
a month's salary on flowers for me, which I promptly sent
to the nearest pauper hospital. She smiles, she nearly breaks
her back genuflexing. Her every second word is "most
submissive," "will the Imperial Highness deign to do this,"
that, or the other thing.</p>

<p>The terror got into her old bones and she trembles for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
her pension, for, of course, she knows that instant dismissal
will be her portion.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus talks of having some more princes
and&mdash;acts accordingly. Perish the thought that his Louise
is an adulteress, that she ever had a lover, has one now!</p>

<p>He is haunting my room, running from door to window,
from window to door. Every little while he opens the
<i>porti&egrave;res</i> to see if no one's coming to address him "Your
Majesty."</p>

<p>"Your popularity with the public is a great asset," he
says over and over again. "Lucky devil I, to have a wife as
smart as you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>November 2, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus came running into my room and
gave me a bear-hug.</p>

<p>"The doctors say the King is lost. Impossible to keep
him alive any longer."</p>

<p>He rushed out.</p>

<p>I am Queen.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 42em;"><i>After Lunch.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>Just back from Richard's studio. We had lunch together.
We laughed, we danced, we sang. We bombarded
one another with pillows.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>We acted the jubilant heirs. I recalled Sybillenort at
the time King Albert died. In Saxony, when man or woman
shuffles off this mortal coil, there's always a good "feed"
at the corpse's expense. At the late King's castle a "mourning
breakfast" was served upon the royal family's arrival
from Dresden&mdash;a most magnificent repast in the matter
of plate and victuals offered, but each had to serve himself
or herself, as servants were dispensed with.</p>

<p>This by the new King's special orders&mdash;that he might
hear himself addressed "Your Majesty" by his kith and kin,
a formality usually neglected in the family circle except
when two or more of the big-wigs are warring against each
other.</p>

<p>"Will Your Majesty have one or two lumps of sugar?"</p>

<p>"May it please Your Majesty&mdash;some steak?"</p>

<p>"I hope Your Majesty will allow me to peel an orange
for Your Majesty."</p>

<p>Thus at Sybillenort. And at Richard's:</p>

<p>"Will Your Greatness (Majesty) deign to take Your
Greatness's feather out of my eye?"</p>

<p>Or: "May it never please Your Transparency (<i>Durchlaucht</i>,
German for Highness) to let <i>His</i> Greatness see
through you."</p>

<p>I am several times a Countess besides a Princess,
Duchess, etc., and Richard continued with his paraphrasing
of titles:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your Illuminatedness<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> makes lights quite unnecessary,"
and he switched them off in a room already darkened by

<h4>WHAT I WILL DO WHEN I AM QUEEN</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A foretaste: titled servants put me <i>en route</i> for lover&mdash;The bargain
I will propose to Frederick Augustus&mdash;Frederick Augustus
will be a complaisant King&mdash;To revive <i>Petit Trianon</i>&mdash;I
am addressed as Queen.</p></div>


<p>
<span class="smcap" style="margin-left: 38em;">Dresden</span>, <i>November 3, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>Though still styled Crown Princess, I am already revelling
in the delights and perquisites of queenship: I do as I
please, go where I please, I would think aloud, as I please, if
anyone dared me.</p>

<p>For all my enemies of a week ago turned flatterers and
flunkeys, bowing, grovelling, fawning, contemptible in their
self-abasement, but quite useful to my purposes.</p>

<p>Like most royal palaces, ours at Dresden has a secret
staircase and exit for emergencies. It is never used by
ladies; only the princes have recourse to it, occasionally, to
drop out of sight in <i>mufti</i>, for, of course, royal incognito is
more or less legitimate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the evening, after our card party was over, Catherine
was seen to dismiss her court and retire to her private
apartments with the new favorite," say the Secret Memoirs
of the Court of St. Petersburg.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Less publicly, perhaps, but even more illegitimately, I
walk the secret staircase <i>en route</i> for my lover whenever
I please nowadays.</p>

<p>I go veiled and&mdash;make the Grand Mistress open the
door for me. She knows that I am on sweet pleasure bent
and&mdash;smiles.</p>

<p>"When will Your Imperial Highness deign to return?"</p>

<p>I name the hour and she is there to receive me&mdash;smirking,
blind, deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>A foretaste of my queenship paradise! No one will
boss me, no one will dare talk about me, everything I do will
be good, even sublime.</p>

<p>I made up my mind as to Frederick Augustus.</p>

<p>"Frederick Augustus," I will say to him, "now that we
are King and Queen, let's enjoy to the full the thing's emoluments;
otherwise, what's the use? You will allow me to
go my way and I will certainly shut both eyes as to your
doings, even if you follow in the footsteps of your namesake
of the three-hundred-and-fifty-two."</p>

<p>Of course, I will say it differently, but my husband will
understand. The main thing: the royal family and court
must stop hurling at me the long, watery <i>haussez les mains</i>
of narrow-minded, provincial inquisitiveness, which both oppresses
and goads me.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus has too much respect for the kingly
dignity to impugn his partner, the Queen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Will I revive, then, the seraglios of the Russian Anns
and Elizabeths, or start a new <i>Parc aux Cerfs</i> with strong
men and Marathon winners for inmates? Thank you, a
miniature <i>Petit Trianon</i> will be good enough for me.</p>

<p>The Tisch entered a minute ago and respectfully remains
at the door, though she sees I am engaged on my
Diary. I watch her in the mirror. She would travel bare-foot
to Kevlaar, of which Heinrich Heine sung, for a glimpse
of what I wrote. Her variegated grimaces give her the
appearance of a carved wooden devil, sprinkled with holy
water.</p>

<p>At last I deign to inquire: "What is it, Baroness?"</p>

<p>"The Crown Prince wants to see Your Imperial Highness.
May he come in?"</p>

<p>"Since when does my husband send you to announce
him?"</p>

<p>"Pardon, Your Imperial Highness, I meant Prince
George."</p>

<p>Designating my first-born Prince Royal, means recognizing
me as Queen.</p>

<p>And, but ten days ago, this same viper refused to address
me by my <i>proper</i> title.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>

</p>

<p>The King has taken nourishment. The King will not
die&mdash;he will live and punish me. Still, I must not complain.
I had a respite and Richard says, "when one rises from the
dead, one is less inclined to be severe with the living." But
he grew rather despondent immediately.</p>

<p>"<i>La libert&eacute; est une garce, qui ne se laisse monter que sur
des matelas des cadavres humains!</i>" he quoted <i>Comte</i> Mirabeau.
Our corpse was alive, our liberty is dead for the time
being.</p>

</p>

<p>The King went driving this morning and I am told that
he came home well pleased, for there was lusty cheering
along the line. Frederick Augustus hasn't mentioned my
affair at all. Disappointment made him rather gloomy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
he begins to treat me again in the right royal Saxon fashion:
I am air for His Highness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 44em;"><i>After Supper.</i></span>
</p>

<p>The family will wait upon His Majesty in a body tomorrow,
to congratulate him on his recovery. After that,
<i>Te Deum</i> in the cathedral, which the court and authorities
must attend by command.</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Highness's pew will be in readiness,
but my sublime master has not deigned to graciously announce
that he wishes to receive Your Imperial Highness,"&mdash;this
from the toad Baumann, who but yesterday licked my
boots.</p>

</p>

<p>Another straw indicating the direction of the wind&mdash;the
ill-wind.</p>

<p>King George commanded Bernhardt to be madman no
longer and come and live in Dresden. Since his arrival he
has paid assiduous court to all members of the royal family,
but me. He called on the royal ministers, the courtiers, the
high civil authorities, but my apartments have seen him not.
I don't blame the boy for making the best of the situation,
but was it really necessary to offer gratuitous insult to the
only relative that stood by him when in trouble?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>Doubtless, he took his cue from the King, who cut me
dead while, with the rest, I thanked God for his recovery.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 40em;"><i>November 20, 1902.</i></span><br />
</p>


<p>The Tisch is openly talking Sonnenstein. "The royal
apartments are ready for her reception," she let fall yesterday.</p>

<p>Old Andrew, my confidential servant, told me.</p>

<p>She shows me the face of a bull-dog about to spring
at a victim, a sea-green devil filled with vinegar and gall,
but affects icy courtesy.</p>

<p>Frederick Augustus is down in the mouth. If he knows
of any evil intention against me, he evidently made up his
mind to hold his tongue and avoid scenes.</p>

<p>Richard keeps on saying: "Don't worry. After all,
what can they do to you?" He doesn't know, or doesn't
want to understand that, while the law holds out protection
for all, from pedlars and vagabonds to and including prime
ministers, royalty itself is only technically above the law;
in <i>praxis</i> we are beyond the benefits of all law, human and
otherwise.</p>

<p>To be sure, a Cit is sometimes unjustly treated, but with
tenacity and a small amount of courage, he finds his remedy
in the courts and in the press.</p>

<p>To royal princes and princesses the King is both judge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
and executioner, as the cases of the Duke of Saxony and
Bernhardt show. Maybe it pleases His Majesty to cloak his
tyranny by convoking a commission, but what of it, since
the commission is invariably made up of his creatures,
trained, if not commanded, to do the all-highest will and
nothing but the all-highest will?</p>

<p>As in days gone by, the poor "witch"&mdash;if she be young
and comely&mdash;must face her accusers naked, the sworn torturer
at her elbow, so I have no standing in law or decency
before the Powers over social life or death in our sphere
of society.</p>

<p>If there be blemishes in my character, the King sees
them magnified by the sharp tongues of evil creatures, his
spies. There is no privacy. I must submit to be stared at,
to have my flesh lacerated by curious eyes, and, as in the case
of the old-time "witches," the handsomest were condemned
the quicker because "the devil was more liable to choose
them for an abode than ugly ones," so my very beauty will
hasten my destruction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span></p>

<p>As I was in the act of retiring last night, a clairvoyant's
vision seized me. "Somebody meddling with your papers!"
"They are breaking into your <i>secr&eacute;taire</i>," the voices said.</p>

<p>I slipped on a pair of bath sandals and stealthily opened
the door of my boudoir.</p>

<p>My writing desk was open, all the drawers ajar and in
disorder; the Baroness bending over this, my Diary. She
was reading like mad, her eyes danced with lust of revenge.</p>

<p>With one bound I was at her side and she was so frightened
at first, I thought she would drop. Her chest seemed
to draw inward; she swayed to and fro. But only for a
second or two. Then, recovering her self-possession, her
fighting harness was in place again.</p>

<p>"Go to your room, Royal Highness," she said in a tone
of command. "These papers are confiscated in the name
of the King."</p>

<p>I was beside myself with rage. "My Diary," I cried;
"instantly return it to me."</p>

<p>More I couldn't say, for I had neither breath nor voice.
My right hand was on the book when she attempted to
seize it.</p>

<p>I struck her hand with Richard's ring&mdash;I wish it was
bigger, I wish it had a good diamond point&mdash;but she wouldn't
let go. Then, before one could count one, two, three, I had
hold of her&mdash;Heaven, how I enjoyed it; the satisfaction I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
had in giving rein to my passion, for all was up now, anyhow.</p>

<p>With the left hand I caught her by the throat, while my
good right boxed her ears after the homely manner mamma
had taught me. Good, sound cuffs, I assure you, each liable
to dislocate a tooth.</p>

<p>"<i>Canaille</i>," I cried, "<i>miserable canaille</i>." I pushed her
into a corner and recovered the Diary, folding it up quickly.
I was holding the book close to my bosom when I crossed
the room to regain my bedchamber.</p>

<p>The Tisch after me, trying to snatch it back. I caught
her on the chest and sent her flying. Then, with the manuscript,
I made good my escape, leaving for the contemptible
bird of prey all my love letters, reams of them, the oldest
fifteen or more years old, the latest bearing yesterday's
date.</p>

<p>Once in my room, I recollected and made a grab at my
throat. The key to my Diary was gone. They stole it,
chain and all, while I was asleep, no doubt.</p>

<p>Awakening, I find myself seated at the little table near
the window. Both my hands are ink-spotted. So is my
night-dress.</p>

<p>I see, I have written an account of the battle. I must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
have done so some time after I returned from the field. It's
well, for at the moment, I don't remember a thing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My titled servants withdraw from me&mdash;An old footman my sole

for me.</p></div>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 40em;"><i>Afternoon.</i></span><br />
</p>

<p>No one has come to see me. My household, my adjutants,
marshal, chamberlains, equerries, the ladies of my
entourage are on duty, but since I ordered my meals brought
to the room, they pretend to assume that I'm too ill to see
anyone. There may be no truth in the saying that rats leave
the ship destined to sink, but the titled vermin royalty surrounds
itself with certainly knows when to avoid dangerous
craft.</p>

<p>I rang for Andrew. The good, old man wouldn't put
me to the humiliation of asking questions.</p>

<p>"Your Imperial Highness's children are with Her
Majesty," he said; and, coming a step nearer, he added in
an undertone: "Baroness Tisch has been with His Majesty
since nine in the morning."</p>

<p>"You are a kind and brave man." I held out my hand.</p>

<p>"If Your Imperial Highness has no immediate orders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
for me," continued the good soul, "I beg to be allowed to
visit my friend, Hans, the King's body-servant."</p>

<p>I thanked Andrew for his good intentions. "Wait in
the ante-chamber until I am dressed."</p>

<p>I donned a forty-mark costume that I keep on hand
for the purpose; it didn't take me more than six or seven
minutes.</p>

<p>"I will have to leave by the secret staircase, Andrew."</p>

<p>He understood and cleared the way for me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<h4>FAMILY COUNCIL AT CASTLE</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Rendezvous at studio&mdash;State takes my children from me&mdash;Madhouse
or flight&mdash;I brought fifty-two trunks to the palace&mdash;Depart
with small satchel&mdash;If I attempt to see my children
I'll be seized as "mad woman"&mdash;Varying emotions of the
last ten minutes&mdash;Threatening shadows thrown on a curtain
decide me&mdash;Ready for flight&mdash;Diary the last thing to go into
the satchel.</p></div>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 40em;"><i>At Night. Eleven O'clock.</i></span><br />
</p>


<p>They went into family council at six tonight and are
still deliberating, Andrew reports. The Tisch, he says, acts
as secretary; His Majesty, of course, presides.</p>

<p>Present are the Dowager Queen, Mathilde and Isabelle.
Then Frederick Augustus, Johann George, Max and Bernhardt.
Baron George von Metzsch, a high government and
court functionary and my enemy, attends as legal adviser to
the King.</p>

<p>It's in the nature of things that the Baron will do his
worst to destroy me, but Bernhardt! Bernhardt, who held
me in his arms, now one of my judges! He will have to be
especially severe with his <i>quondam</i> mistress lest the King
suspect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span></p>

<p>While the sweet family bent over those love letters&mdash;I
bet the Tisch withheld Henry's&mdash;I sat in Richard's studio,
advising with him.</p>

<p>"There are only two things to be considered: the madhouse
or instant flight."</p>

<p>"You dare advise me to leave my children?"</p>

<p>"There are no nurseries in madhouses. Your children
are lost to you, anyhow. If you remain, as an alleged insane
person, you 'can't be trusted,' they'll argue, for you
are helpless, legally, morally and physically.</p>

<p>"If you run away to Switzerland, on the other hand,
you are a free woman, under the protection of a republican
government.</p>

<p>"Switzerland, I needn't tell you, will not go to war to
wrest your children from the royal family, but will afford
you personally every advantage, legal and otherwise.</p>

<p>"Decide quickly: are you going to make King George a
present of yourself as well as of the five children you bore
for the benefit of the Wettiners?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My mind is made up. My few belongings are packed.
I, who came to Dresden with fifty-two trunks, leave the palace
with a satchel, easy to carry. I take nothing but my
personal jewels, the little money I own and some changes
of linen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>If I could only see my children for a moment or two,
but the Queen has them in her keeping, and I might be
seized as a "mad woman" if I dared leave my apartments
and cross to those occupied by Her Majesty.</p>

<p>And Frederick Augustus! He will miss me in his way.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Ten more minutes. I hear the distant clatter of a carriage.
Richard driving to our rendezvous, two streets north
of the palace gate.</p>

<p>Will my limbs carry me to him and liberty? I pace the
room to test their strength.</p>

<p>"Louise," says the voice within,&mdash;"your last chance.
Your good-natured husband, your darling children, your old
parents, pomp and state and circumstance, indeed, a crown,
you are going to abandon for&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>A man whose carnal side only you know, a poor
man, an artist without fame, a professional without
future.</p>

<p>Sadly perturbed in mind, I walk to the window. Those
of His Majesty's cabinet, where the family council is in
progress, are directly opposite.</p>

<p>Shadows of men and women, rising from a sitting position,
are thrown on the curtains.</p>

<p>One of the shades slowly ascends.</p>

<p>I see the Tisch pointing a bony finger to the windows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
of my boudoir. Von Metzsch stands by her side. They grin.</p>

<p>You triumph, wretch and Jezebel?</p>

<p>But when your <i>sbirri</i>, in an hour from now, or tomorrow
morning early, invade my rooms, instructed to carry
me away&mdash;bound hand and foot to a sofa, or in a straight
jacket, perhaps&mdash;they will find the Crown Princess gone&mdash;her
and her Diary.</p>

<p>Both will be safe on foreign soil ere you can make
arrangements for organized pursuit, for Richard and I will
travel by carriage to a distant suburb, there mount the fast
express and keep to our state room, engaged under an
assumed name, until without the sphere of Saxon or German
influence.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A discreet knock. Andrew, my liberator! In his hand
a tallow dip to light this Imperial Highness down back stairs
to the new life of her choice.</p>

<p>"One moment, old man, this book goes into the valise.</p>

<p>"Hand me the blotter, please. Tears won't do.</p>

<p>"And a couple more handkerchiefs from the top of the
chiffonier, please."</p>
